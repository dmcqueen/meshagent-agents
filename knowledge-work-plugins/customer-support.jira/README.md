# Claude Customer Support Jira

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's customer support knowledge work plugin with Jira Rovo MCP integration and a nightly docs sync worker

## Description

This agent helps customer support teams manage and resolve Jira-based tickets by turning vague requests into clear, actionable plans, drafting responses, and suggesting appropriate escalations or knowledge-base updates. Teams can use it to triage incoming issues, create or improve KB articles, and coordinate escalations to resolve customer problems more quickly and consistently. It also supports adapting guidance to specific goals and constraints so responses and workflows align with team priorities. A nightly sync ensures documentation stays current so the team’s knowledge and suggested actions reflect the latest information.
