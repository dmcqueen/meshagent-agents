# Claude Customer Support With Jira Connector

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's customer support knowledge work plugin with Jira Rovo MCP integration and a nightly docs sync worker

## Description

This agent enables customer support teams to research issues, triage and escalate tickets, draft and refine responses, and create or update knowledge-base articles to improve resolution times and consistency. It helps turn ambiguous support requests into clear, actionable tasks and provides guidance tailored to user goals, constraints, and context so teams can prioritize work and communicate effectively. Nightly documentation syncs keep knowledge up to date while integrations with ticketing workflows let teams escalate and track issues within their existing support process. Overall, the agent streamlines customer-research, knowledge management, and response workflows to reduce friction across support operations.
