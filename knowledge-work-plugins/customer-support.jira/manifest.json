  "description": "An agent that uses Anthropic's customer support knowledge work plugin with Jira Rovo MCP integration and a nightly docs sync worker",
  "long_description": "This agent helps customer support teams triage and resolve issues with Jira and Jira Service Management through Atlassian Rovo MCP integration, while using synced MeshAgent documentation for accurate product guidance. It supports core support workflows including ticket triage, duplicate checks, escalation packaging, customer-response drafting, knowledge-base drafting, and issue research with source attribution. Teams can use it to route work to the right queue, maintain consistent customer communication, and prepare high-quality escalation briefs with links to related Jira items. Nightly documentation sync keeps support guidance current, and connected Jira tooling improves traceability from intake through escalation and resolution.",
