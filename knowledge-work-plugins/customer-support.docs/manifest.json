  "long_description": "This plugin supports customer support workflows and is designed to help users complete practical work with less manual effort. It can triage customer issues and prioritize urgent cases, draft clear, empathetic responses and follow-up messages, and propose next steps that move tickets toward resolution. Built-in guidance and reusable skills help keep outputs consistent, context-aware, and action-oriented. It works well for both quick answers and multi-step tasks that require planning, drafting, and refinement. Teams can use it as a day-to-day assistant for customer support decisions, analysis, and communication.",
