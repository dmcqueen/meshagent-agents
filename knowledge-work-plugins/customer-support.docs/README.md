# Claude Customer Support MeshAgent

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's customer support knowledge work plugin with a nightly docs sync worker

## Description

This agent helps customer support teams triage incoming issues, prioritize urgent cases, and keep tickets moving toward resolution by proposing actionable next steps. Teams can use it to draft clear, empathetic responses and follow-up messages tailored to customer context, and to prepare escalation notes when higher-level intervention is needed. It also supports creating and updating knowledge-base articles and conducting focused customer research to inform consistent, efficient responses. A nightly synchronization of documentation keeps its recommendations aligned with the latest support content so teams get up-to-date guidance for handling recurring problems.
