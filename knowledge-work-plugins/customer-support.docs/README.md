# Claude Customer Support MeshAgent

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's customer support knowledge work plugin with a nightly docs sync worker

## Description

This agent helps customer support teams triage incoming issues, prioritize urgent cases, and move tickets toward resolution by proposing clear next steps. It can draft empathetic, professional responses and follow-up messages to customers, generate knowledge-base articles and research summaries to inform support decisions, and recommend when to escalate problems. Teams can use it to standardize responses, speed up handling of volume, and improve knowledge management so recurrent issues are resolved faster. A nightly documentation sync keeps its reference materials up to date so outputs align with the latest support guidance.
