# Claude Customer Support MeshAgent

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's customer support knowledge work plugin with a nightly docs sync worker

## Description

This agent helps customer support teams triage incoming issues, prioritize urgent cases, and move tickets toward timely resolution by proposing clear next steps and escalation paths. Teams can use it to draft empathetic, professional responses and follow-up messages, create or update knowledge-base articles, and capture research that informs recurring problem patterns. With a nightly documentation sync worker, it keeps support content current so agents have up-to-date guidance when resolving tickets and escalating complex cases. The overall outcome is faster, more consistent handling of customer issues and improved knowledge management across support workflows.
