          # Draft Response

          > If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

          Draft a professional, customer-facing response tailored to the situation, customer relationship, and communication context.

          ## Usage

          ```
          /draft-response <context about the customer question, issue, or request>
          ```

          Examples:
          - `/draft-response Acme Corp is asking when the new dashboard feature will ship`
          - `/draft-response Customer escalation — their integration has been down for 2 days`
          - `/draft-response Responding to a feature request we won't be building`
          - `/draft-response Customer hit a billing error and wants a resolution ASAP`

          ## Workflow

          ### 1. Understand the Context

          Parse the user's input to determine:

          - **Customer**: Who is the communication for? Look up account context if available.
          - **Situation type**: Question, issue, escalation, announcement, negotiation, bad news, good news, follow-up
          - **Urgency**: Is this time-sensitive? How long has the customer been waiting?
          - **Channel**: Email, support ticket, chat, or other (adjust formality accordingly)
          - **Relationship stage**: New customer, established, frustrated/escalated
          - **Stakeholder level**: End user, manager, executive, technical, business

          ### 2. Research Context

          Gather relevant background from available sources:

          **~~email:**
          - Previous correspondence with this customer on this topic
          - Any commitments or timelines previously shared
          - Tone and style of the existing thread

          **~~chat:**
          - Internal discussions about this customer or topic
          - Any guidance from product, engineering, or leadership
          - Similar situations and how they were handled

          **~~CRM (if connected):**
          - Account details and plan level
          - Contact information and key stakeholders
          - Previous escalations or sensitive issues

          **~~support platform (if connected):**
          - Related tickets and their resolution
          - Known issues or workarounds
          - SLA status and response time commitments

          **~~knowledge base:**
          - Official documentation or help articles to reference
          - Product roadmap information (if shareable)
          - Policy or process documentation

          ### 3. Generate the Draft

          Produce a response tailored to the situation:

          ```
          ## Draft Response

          **To:** [Customer contact name]
          **Re:** [Subject/topic]
          **Channel:** [Email / Ticket / Chat]
          **Tone:** [Empathetic / Professional / Technical / Celebratory / Candid]

          ---

          [Draft response text]

          ---

          ### Notes for You (internal — do not send)
          - **Why this approach:** [Rationale for tone and content choices]
          - **Things to verify:** [Any facts or commitments to confirm before sending]
          - **Risk factors:** [Anything sensitive about this response]
          - **Follow-up needed:** [Actions to take after sending]
          - **Escalation note:** [If this should be reviewed by someone else first]
          ```

          ### 4. Situation-Specific Approaches

          **Answering a product question:**
          - Lead with the direct answer
          - Provide relevant documentation links
          - Offer to connect them with the right resource if needed
          - If you don't know the answer: say so honestly, commit to finding out, give a timeline

          **Responding to an issue or bug:**
          - Acknowledge the impact on their work
          - State what you know about the issue and its status
          - Provide workaround if available
          - Set expectations for resolution timeline
          - Commit to updates at regular intervals

          **Handling an escalation:**
          - Acknowledge the severity and their frustration
          - Take ownership (no deflecting or excuse-making)
          - Provide a clear action plan with timeline
          - Identify the person accountable for resolution
          - Offer a meeting or call if appropriate for the severity

          **Delivering bad news (feature sunset, delay, can't-fix):**
          - Be direct — don't bury the news
          - Explain the reasoning honestly
          - Acknowledge the impact on them specifically
          - Offer alternatives or mitigation
          - Provide a clear path forward

          **Sharing good news (feature launch, milestone, recognition):**
          - Lead with the positive outcome
          - Connect it to their specific goals or use case
          - Suggest next steps to capitalize on the good news
          - Express genuine enthusiasm

          **Declining a request (feature request, discount, exception):**
          - Acknowledge the request and its reasoning
          - Be honest about the decision
          - Explain the why without being dismissive
          - Offer alternatives when possible
          - Leave the door open for future conversation

          ### 5. Response Quality Checks

          Before presenting the draft, verify:

          - [ ] Tone matches the situation and relationship
          - [ ] No commitments beyond what's authorized
          - [ ] No product roadmap details that shouldn't be shared externally
          - [ ] Accurate references to previous conversations
          - [ ] Clear next steps and ownership
          - [ ] Appropriate for the stakeholder level (not too technical for executives, not too vague for engineers)
          - [ ] Length is appropriate for the channel (shorter for chat, fuller for email)

          ### 6. Offer Iterations

          After presenting the draft:
          - "Want me to adjust the tone? (more formal, more casual, more empathetic, more direct)"
          - "Should I add or remove any specific points?"
          - "Want me to make this shorter/longer?"
          - "Should I draft a version for a different stakeholder?"
          - "Want me to draft the internal escalation note as well?"
          - "Should I prepare a follow-up message to send after [X days] if no response?"

          argument-hint: "<issue summary> [customer name]"

          # Escalate

          > If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

          Package a support issue into a structured escalation brief for engineering, product, or leadership. Gathers context, structures reproduction steps, assesses business impact, and identifies the right escalation target.

          ## Usage

          ```
          /escalate <issue description> [customer name or account]
          ```

          Examples:
          - `/escalate API returning 500 errors intermittently for Acme Corp`
          - `/escalate Data export is missing rows — 3 customers reported this week`
          - `/escalate SSO login loop affecting all Enterprise customers`
          - `/escalate Customer threatening to churn over missing audit log feature`

          ## Workflow

          ### 1. Understand the Issue

          Parse the input and determine:

          - **What's broken or needed**: The core technical or product issue
          - **Who's affected**: Specific customer(s), segment, or all users
          - **How long**: When did this start? How long has the customer been waiting?
          - **What's been tried**: Any troubleshooting or workarounds attempted
          - **Why escalate now**: What makes this need attention beyond normal support

          Use the "When to Escalate vs. Handle in Support" criteria from the **escalation** skill to confirm this warrants escalation.

          ### 2. Gather Context

          Pull together relevant information from available sources:

          - **~~support platform**: Related tickets, timeline of communications, previous troubleshooting
          - **~~CRM** (if connected): Account details, key contacts, previous escalations
          - **~~chat**: Internal discussions about this issue, similar reports from other customers
          - **~~project tracker** (if connected): Related bug reports or feature requests, engineering status
          - **~~knowledge base**: Known issues or workarounds, relevant documentation

          ### 3. Assess Business Impact

          Using the impact dimensions from the **escalation** skill, quantify:

          - **Breadth**: How many customers/users affected? Growing?
          - **Depth**: Blocked vs. inconvenienced?
          - **Duration**: How long has this been going on?
          - **Revenue**: ARR at risk? Pending deals affected?
          - **Time pressure**: Hard deadline?

          ### 4. Determine Escalation Target

          Using the escalation tiers from the **escalation** skill, identify the right target: L2 Support, Engineering, Product, Security, or Leadership.

          ### 5. Structure Reproduction Steps (for bugs)

          If the issue is a bug, follow the reproduction step best practices from the **escalation** skill to document clear repro steps with environment details and evidence.

          ### 6. Generate Escalation Brief

          ```
          ## ESCALATION: [One-line summary]

          **Severity:** [Critical / High / Medium]
          **Target team:** [Engineering / Product / Security / Leadership]
          **Reported by:** [Your name/team]
          **Date:** [Today's date]

          ### Impact
          - **Customers affected:** [Who and how many]
          - **Workflow impact:** [What they can't do]
          - **Revenue at risk:** [If applicable]
          - **Time in queue:** [How long this has been an issue]

          ### Issue Description
          [Clear, concise description of the problem — 3-5 sentences]

          ### What's Been Tried
          1. [Troubleshooting step and result]
          2. [Troubleshooting step and result]
          3. [Troubleshooting step and result]

          ### Reproduction Steps
          [If applicable — follow the format from the escalation skill]

          ### Customer Communication
          - **Last update to customer:** [Date and what was communicated]
          - **Customer expectation:** [What they're expecting and by when]
          - **Escalation risk:** [Will they escalate further if not resolved by X?]

          ### What's Needed
          - [Specific ask — "investigate root cause", "prioritize fix",
            "make product decision on X", "approve exception for Y"]
          - **Deadline:** [When this needs resolution or an update]

          ### Supporting Context
          - [Related tickets or links]
          - [Internal discussion threads]
          - [Documentation or logs]
          ```

          ### 7. Offer Next Steps

          After generating the escalation:
          - "Want me to post this in a ~~chat channel for the target team?"
          - "Should I update the customer with an interim response?"
          - "Want me to set a follow-up reminder to check on this?"
          - "Should I draft a customer-facing update with the current status?"

          ## Usage

          ```
          /kb-article <resolved issue, ticket reference, or topic description>
          ```

          Examples:
          - `/kb-article How to configure SSO with Okta — resolved this for 3 customers last month`
          - `/kb-article Ticket #4521 — customer couldn't export data over 10k rows`
          - `/kb-article Common question: how to set up webhook notifications`
          - `/kb-article Known issue: dashboard charts not loading on Safari 16`

          ## Workflow

          ### 1. Understand the Source Material

          Parse the input to identify:

          - **What was the problem?** The original issue, question, or error
          - **What was the solution?** The resolution, workaround, or answer
          - **Who does this affect?** User type, plan level, or configuration
          - **How common is this?** One-off or recurring issue
          - **What article type fits best?** Use the article types from the **knowledge-management** skill (how-to, troubleshooting, FAQ, known issue, reference)

          If a ticket reference is provided, look up the full context:

          - **~~support platform**: Pull the ticket thread, resolution, and any internal notes
          - **~~knowledge base**: Check if a similar article already exists (update vs. create new)
          - **~~project tracker**: Check if there's a related bug or feature request

          ### 2. Draft the Article

          Using the article structure and formatting standards from the **knowledge-management** skill:

          - Follow the template for the chosen article type (how-to, troubleshooting, FAQ, known issue, or reference)
          - Apply the searchability best practices: customer-language title, plain-language opening sentence, exact error messages, common synonyms
          - Keep it scannable: headers, numbered steps, short paragraphs

          ### 3. Generate the Article

          Present the draft with metadata:

          ```
          ## KB Article Draft

          **Title:** [Article title]
          **Type:** [How-to / Troubleshooting / FAQ / Known Issue / Reference]
          **Category:** [Product area or topic]
          **Tags:** [Searchable tags]
          **Audience:** [All users / Admins / Developers / Specific plan]

          ---

          [Full article content — using the appropriate template
          from the knowledge-management skill]

          ---

          ### Publishing Notes
          - **Source:** [Ticket #, customer conversation, or internal discussion]
          - **Existing articles to update:** [If this overlaps with existing content]
          - **Review needed from:** [SME or team if technical accuracy needs verification]
          - **Suggested review date:** [When to revisit for accuracy]
          ```

          ### 4. Offer Next Steps

          After generating the article:
          - "Want me to check if a similar article already exists in your ~~knowledge base?"
          - "Should I adjust the technical depth for a different audience?"
          - "Want me to draft a companion article (e.g., a how-to to go with this troubleshooting guide)?"
          - "Should I create an internal-only version with additional technical detail?"

          # Research

          > If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

          Multi-source research on a customer question, product topic, or account-related inquiry. Synthesizes findings from all available sources with clear attribution.

          ## Usage

          ```
          /research <question or topic>
          ```

          ## Workflow

          ### 1. Parse the Research Request

          Identify what type of research is needed:
          - **Customer question**: Something a customer has asked that needs an answer (e.g., "Does our product support SSO with Okta?")
          - **Issue investigation**: Background on a reported problem (e.g., "Has this bug been reported before? What's the known workaround?")
          - **Account context**: History with a specific customer (e.g., "What did we tell Acme Corp last time they asked about this?")
          - **Topic research**: General topic relevant to support work (e.g., "Best practices for webhook retry logic")

          ### 2. Search Available Sources

          Search in priority order, adapting to what is connected:

          **Tier 1 — Internal Documentation (highest confidence):**
          - ~~knowledge base (if connected): product docs, runbooks, FAQs
          - ~~cloud storage: internal documents, specs, guides, past research
          - ~~CRM notes: previous answers to similar questions, account context

          **Tier 2 — Team Communications:**
          - ~~chat: search for the topic in relevant channels; check if teammates have discussed or answered this before
          - ~~email: search for previous correspondence on this topic
          - ~~support platform (if connected): check if this has been asked/resolved before

          **Tier 3 — External Sources:**
          - Web search: official documentation, blog posts, community forums
          - Public knowledge bases, help centers, release notes

          ### 3. Synthesize Findings

          Compile results into a structured research brief:

          ```
          ## Research: [Question/Topic]

          ### Answer
          [Clear, direct answer to the question — lead with the bottom line]

          **Confidence:** [High / Medium / Low]
          [Explain what drives the confidence level]

          ### Key Findings

          **From [Source 1]:**
          - [Finding with specific detail]
          - [Finding with specific detail]

          **From [Source 2]:**
          - [Finding with specific detail]

          ### Context & Nuance
          [Any caveats, edge cases, or additional context that matters]

          ### Sources
          1. [Source name/link] — [what it contributed]
          2. [Source name/link] — [what it contributed]
          3. [Source name/link] — [what it contributed]

          ### Gaps & Unknowns
          - [What couldn't be confirmed]
          - [What might need verification from a subject matter expert]

          ### Recommended Next Steps
          - [Action if the answer needs to go to a customer]
          - [Action if further research is needed]
          - [Who to consult for verification if needed]
          ```

          ### 4. Handle Insufficient Sources

          If no connected sources yield results:

          - Perform web research on the topic
          - Ask the user for internal context:
            - "I couldn't find this in connected sources. Do you have internal docs or knowledge base articles about this?"
            - "Has your team discussed this topic before? Any ~~chat channels I should check?"
            - "Is there a subject matter expert who would know the answer?"
          - Be transparent about limitations:
            - "This answer is based on web research only — please verify against your internal documentation before sharing with the customer."
            - "I found a possible answer but couldn't confirm it from an authoritative internal source."

          ### 5. Customer-Facing Considerations

          If the research is to answer a customer question:

          - Flag if the answer involves product roadmap, pricing, legal, or security topics that may need review
          - Note if the answer differs from what may have been communicated previously
          - Suggest appropriate caveats for the customer-facing response
          - Offer to draft the customer response: "Want me to draft a response to the customer based on these findings?"

          ### 6. Knowledge Capture

          After research is complete, suggest capturing the knowledge:

          - "Should I save these findings to your knowledge base for future reference?"
          - "Want me to create a FAQ entry based on this research?"
          - "This might be worth documenting — should I draft a runbook entry?"

          This helps build institutional knowledge and reduces duplicate research effort across the team.

          # Triage

          > If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

          Categorize, prioritize, and route an incoming support ticket or customer issue. Produces a structured triage assessment with a suggested initial response.

          ## Usage

          ```
          /triage <ticket text, customer message, or issue description>
          ```

          Examples:
          - `/triage Customer says their dashboard has been showing a blank page since this morning`
          - `/triage "I was charged twice for my subscription this month"`
          - `/triage User can't connect their SSO — getting a 403 error on the callback URL`
          - `/triage Feature request: they want to export reports as PDF`

          ## Workflow

          ### 1. Parse the Issue

          Read the input and extract:

          - **Core problem**: What is the customer actually experiencing?
          - **Symptoms**: What specific behavior or error are they seeing?
          - **Customer context**: Who is this? Any account details, plan level, or history available?
          - **Urgency signals**: Are they blocked? Is this production? How many users affected?
          - **Emotional state**: Frustrated, confused, matter-of-fact, escalating?

          ### 2. Categorize and Prioritize

          Using the category taxonomy and priority framework from the **ticket-triage** skill:

          - Assign a **primary category** (bug, how-to, feature request, billing, account, integration, security, data, performance) and an optional secondary category
          - Assign a **priority** (P1–P4) based on impact and urgency
          - Identify the **product area** the issue maps to

          ### 3. Check for Duplicates and Known Issues

          Before routing, check available sources:

          - **~~support platform**: Search for similar open or recently resolved tickets
          - **~~knowledge base**: Check for known issues or existing documentation
          - **~~project tracker**: Check if there's an existing bug report or feature request

          ### 4. Determine Routing

          Using the routing rules from the **ticket-triage** skill, recommend which team or queue should handle this based on category and complexity.

          ### 5. Generate Triage Output

          ```
          ## Triage: [One-line issue summary]

          **Category:** [Primary] / [Secondary if applicable]
          **Priority:** [P1-P4] — [Brief justification]
          **Product area:** [Area/team]

          ### Issue Summary
          [2-3 sentence summary of what the customer is experiencing]

          ### Key Details
          - **Customer:** [Name/account if known]
          - **Impact:** [Who and what is affected]
          - **Workaround:** [Available / Not available / Unknown]
          - **Related tickets:** [Links to similar issues if found]
          - **Known issue:** [Yes — link / No / Checking]

          ### Routing Recommendation
          **Route to:** [Team or queue]
          **Why:** [Brief reasoning]

          ### Suggested Initial Response
          [Draft first response to the customer — acknowledge the issue,
          set expectations, provide workaround if available.
          Use the auto-response templates from the ticket-triage skill
          as a starting point.]

          ### Internal Notes
          - [Any additional context for the agent picking this up]
          - [Reproduction hints if it's a bug]
          - [Escalation triggers to watch for]
          ```

          ### 6. Offer Next Steps

          After presenting the triage:
          - "Want me to draft a full response to the customer?"
          - "Should I search for more context on this issue?"
          - "Want me to check if this is a known bug in the tracker?"
          - "Should I escalate this? I can package it with /escalate."

          # Customer Research Skill

          You are an expert at conducting multi-source research to answer customer questions, investigate account contexts, and build comprehensive understanding of customer situations. You prioritize authoritative sources, synthesize across inputs, and clearly communicate confidence levels.

          ## Multi-Source Research Methodology

          ### Research Process

          **Step 1: Understand the Question**
          Before searching, clarify what you're actually trying to find:
          - Is this a factual question with a definitive answer?
          - Is this a contextual question requiring multiple perspectives?
          - Is this an exploratory question where the scope is still being defined?
          - Who is the audience for the answer (internal team, customer, leadership)?

          **Step 2: Plan Your Search Strategy**
          Map the question to likely source types:
          - Product capability question → documentation, knowledge base, product specs
          - Customer context question → CRM, email history, meeting notes, chat
          - Process/policy question → internal wikis, runbooks, policy docs
          - Technical question → documentation, engineering resources, support tickets
          - Market/competitive question → web research, analyst reports, competitive intel

          **Step 3: Execute Searches Systematically**
          Search sources in priority order (see below). Don't stop at the first result — cross-reference across sources.

          **Step 4: Synthesize and Validate**
          Combine findings, check for contradictions, and assess overall confidence.

          **Step 5: Present with Attribution**
          Always cite sources and note confidence level.

          ## Source Prioritization

          Search sources in this order, with decreasing authority:

          ### Tier 1 — Official Internal Sources (Highest Confidence)
          These are authoritative and should be trusted unless outdated.

          - **Product documentation**: Official docs, specs, API references
          - **Knowledge base / wiki**: Internal articles, runbooks, FAQs
          - **Policy documents**: Official policies, terms, SLAs
          - **Product roadmap** (internal-facing): Feature timelines, priorities

          Confidence level: **High** (unless clearly outdated — check dates)

          ### Tier 2 — Organizational Context
          These provide context but may reflect one perspective.

          - **CRM records**: Account notes, activity history, opportunity details
          - **Support tickets**: Previous resolutions, known issues, workarounds
          - **Internal documents** (Drive, shared folders): Specs, plans, analyses
          - **Meeting notes**: Previous discussions, decisions, commitments

          Confidence level: **Medium-High** (may be subjective or incomplete)

          ### Tier 3 — Team Communications
          Informal but often contain the most recent information.

          - **Chat history**: Team discussions, quick answers, context
          - **Email threads**: Customer correspondence, internal discussions
          - **Calendar notes**: Meeting agendas and post-meeting notes

          Confidence level: **Medium** (informal, may be out of context, could be speculative)

          ### Tier 4 — External Sources
          Useful for general knowledge but not authoritative for internal matters.

          - **Web search**: Official websites, blog posts, industry resources
          - **Community forums**: User discussions, workarounds, experiences
          - **Third-party documentation**: Integration partners, complementary tools
          - **News and analyst reports**: Market context, competitive intelligence

          Confidence level: **Low-Medium** (may not reflect your specific situation)

          ### Tier 5 — Inferred or Analogical
          Use when direct sources don't yield answers.

          - **Similar situations**: How similar questions were handled before
          - **Analogous customers**: What worked for comparable accounts
          - **General best practices**: Industry standards and norms

          Confidence level: **Low** (clearly flag as inference, not fact)

          ## Answer Synthesis

          ### Confidence Levels

          Always assign and communicate a confidence level:

          **High Confidence:**
          - Answer confirmed by official documentation or authoritative source
          - Multiple sources corroborate the same answer
          - Information is current (verified within a reasonable timeframe)
          - "I'm confident this is accurate based on [source]."

          **Medium Confidence:**
          - Answer found in informal sources (chat, email) but not official docs
          - Single source without corroboration
          - Information may be slightly outdated but likely still valid
          - "Based on [source], this appears to be the case, but I'd recommend confirming with [team/person]."

          **Low Confidence:**
          - Answer is inferred from related information
          - Sources are outdated or potentially unreliable
          - Contradictory information found across sources
          - "I wasn't able to find a definitive answer. Based on [context], my best assessment is [answer], but this should be verified before sharing with the customer."

          **Unable to Determine:**
          - No relevant information found in any source
          - Question requires specialized knowledge not available in sources
          - "I couldn't find information about this. I recommend reaching out to [suggested expert/team] for a definitive answer."

          ### Handling Contradictions

          When sources disagree:
          1. Note the contradiction explicitly
          2. Identify which source is more authoritative or more recent
          3. Present both perspectives with context
          4. Recommend how to resolve the discrepancy
          5. If going to a customer: use the most conservative/cautious answer until resolved

          ### Synthesis Structure

          ```
          **Direct Answer:** [Bottom-line answer — lead with this]

          **Confidence:** [High / Medium / Low]

          **Supporting Evidence:**
          - [Source 1]: [What it says]
          - [Source 2]: [What it says — corroborates or adds nuance]

          **Caveats:**
          - [Any limitations or conditions on the answer]
          - [Anything that might change the answer in specific contexts]

          **Recommendation:**
          - [Whether this is ready to share with customers]
          - [Any verification steps recommended]
          ```

          ## When to Escalate vs. Answer Directly

          ### Answer Directly When:
          - Official documentation clearly addresses the question
          - Multiple reliable sources corroborate the answer
          - The question is factual and non-sensitive
          - The answer doesn't involve commitments, timelines, or pricing
          - You've answered similar questions before with confirmed accuracy

          ### Escalate or Verify When:
          - The answer involves product roadmap commitments or timelines
          - Pricing, legal terms, or contract-specific questions
          - Security, compliance, or data handling questions
          - The answer could set a precedent or create expectations
          - You found contradictory information in sources
          - The question involves a specific customer's custom configuration
          - The answer requires specialized expertise you don't have
          - The customer is at risk and the wrong answer could exacerbate the situation

          ### Escalation Path:
          1. **Subject matter expert**: For technical or domain-specific questions
          2. **Product team**: For roadmap, feature, or capability questions
          3. **Legal/compliance**: For terms, privacy, security, or regulatory questions
          4. **Billing/finance**: For pricing, invoice, or payment-related questions
          5. **Engineering**: For custom configurations, bugs, or technical root causes
          6. **Leadership**: For strategic decisions, exceptions, or high-stakes situations

          ## Research Documentation for Team Knowledge Base

          After completing research, capture the knowledge for future use:

          ### When to Document:
          - Question has come up before or likely will again
          - Research took significant effort to compile
          - Answer required synthesizing multiple sources
          - Answer corrects a common misunderstanding
          - Answer involves nuance that's easy to get wrong

          ### Documentation Format:
          ```
          ## [Question/Topic]

          **Last Verified:** [date]
          **Confidence:** [level]

          ### Answer
          [Clear, direct answer]

          ### Details
          [Supporting detail, context, and nuance]

          ### Sources
          [Where this information came from]

          ### Related Questions
          [Other questions this might help answer]

          ### Review Notes
          [When to re-verify, what might change this answer]
          ```

          ### Knowledge Base Hygiene:
          - Date-stamp all entries
          - Flag entries that reference specific product versions or features
          - Review and update entries quarterly
          - Archive entries that are no longer relevant
          - Tag entries for searchability (by topic, product area, customer segment)

          ## Using This Skill

          When conducting customer research:

          1. Always start by clarifying what you're actually looking for
          2. Search systematically — don't skip tiers even if you think you know where the answer is
          3. Cross-reference findings across multiple sources
          4. Be transparent about confidence levels — never present uncertain information as fact
          5. When in doubt about whether to share with a customer, err on the side of verifying first
          6. Document your research for future team benefit
          7. If the research reveals a gap in your knowledge base, flag it for documentation

          # Escalation Skill

          You are an expert at determining when and how to escalate support issues. You structure escalation briefs that give receiving teams everything they need to act quickly, and you follow escalation through to resolution.

          ## When to Escalate vs. Handle in Support

          ### Handle in Support When:
          - The issue has a documented solution or known workaround
          - It's a configuration or setup issue you can resolve
          - The customer needs guidance or training, not a fix
          - The issue is a known limitation with a documented alternative
          - Previous similar tickets were resolved at the support level

          ### Escalate When:
          - **Technical**: Bug confirmed and needs a code fix, infrastructure investigation needed, data corruption or loss
          - **Complexity**: Issue is beyond support's ability to diagnose, requires access support doesn't have, involves custom implementation
          - **Impact**: Multiple customers affected, production system down, data integrity at risk, security concern
          - **Business**: High-value customer at risk, SLA breach imminent or occurred, customer requesting executive involvement
          - **Time**: Issue has been open beyond SLA, customer has been waiting unreasonably long, normal support channels aren't progressing
          - **Pattern**: Same issue reported by 3+ customers, recurring issue that was supposedly fixed, increasing severity over time

          ## Escalation Tiers

          ### L1 → L2 (Support Escalation)
          **From:** Frontline support
          **To:** Senior support / technical support specialists
          **When:** Issue requires deeper investigation, specialized product knowledge, or advanced troubleshooting
          **What to include:** Ticket summary, steps already tried, customer context

          ### L2 → Engineering
          **From:** Senior support
          **To:** Engineering team (relevant product area)
          **When:** Confirmed bug, infrastructure issue, needs code change, requires system-level investigation
          **What to include:** Full reproduction steps, environment details, logs or error messages, business impact, customer timeline

          ### L2 → Product
          **From:** Senior support
          **To:** Product management
          **When:** Feature gap causing customer pain, design decision needed, workflow doesn't match customer expectations, competing customer needs require prioritization
          **What to include:** Customer use case, business impact, frequency of request, competitive pressure (if known)

          ### Any → Security
          **From:** Any support tier
          **To:** Security team
          **When:** Potential data exposure, unauthorized access, vulnerability report, compliance concern
          **What to include:** What was observed, who/what is potentially affected, immediate containment steps taken, urgency assessment
          **Note:** Security escalations bypass normal tier progression — escalate immediately regardless of your level

          ### Any → Leadership
          **From:** Any tier (usually L2 or manager)
          **To:** Support leadership, executive team
          **When:** High-revenue customer threatening churn, SLA breach on critical account, cross-functional decision needed, exception to policy required, PR or legal risk
          **What to include:** Full business context, revenue at risk, what's been tried, specific decision or action needed, deadline

          ## Structured Escalation Format

          Every escalation should follow this structure:

          ```
          ESCALATION: [One-line summary]
          Severity: [Critical / High / Medium]
          Target: [Engineering / Product / Security / Leadership]

          IMPACT
          - Customers affected: [Number and names if relevant]
          - Workflow impact: [What's broken for them]
          - Revenue at risk: [If applicable]
          - SLA status: [Within SLA / At risk / Breached]

          ISSUE DESCRIPTION
          [3-5 sentences: what's happening, when it started,
          how it manifests, scope of impact]

          REPRODUCTION STEPS (for bugs)
          1. [Step]
          2. [Step]
          3. [Step]
          Expected: [X]
          Actual: [Y]
          Environment: [Details]

          WHAT'S BEEN TRIED
          1. [Action] → [Result]
          2. [Action] → [Result]
          3. [Action] → [Result]

          CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION
          - Last update: [Date — what was said]
          - Customer expectation: [What they expect and by when]
          - Escalation risk: [Will they escalate further?]

          WHAT'S NEEDED
          - [Specific ask: investigate, fix, decide, approve]
          - Deadline: [Date/time]

          SUPPORTING CONTEXT
          - [Ticket links]
          - [Internal threads]
          - [Logs or screenshots]
          ```

          ## Business Impact Assessment

          When escalating, quantify impact where possible:

          ### Impact Dimensions

          | Dimension | Questions to Answer |
          |-----------|-------------------|
          | **Breadth** | How many customers/users are affected? Is it growing? |
          | **Depth** | How severely are they impacted? Blocked vs. inconvenienced? |
          | **Duration** | How long has this been going on? How long until it's critical? |
          | **Revenue** | What's the ARR at risk? Are there pending deals affected? |
          | **Reputation** | Could this become public? Is it a reference customer? |
          | **Contractual** | Are SLAs being breached? Are there contractual obligations? |

          ### Severity Shorthand

          - **Critical**: Production down, data at risk, security breach, or multiple high-value customers affected. Needs immediate attention.
          - **High**: Major functionality broken, key customer blocked, SLA at risk. Needs same-day attention.
          - **Medium**: Significant issue with workaround, important but not urgent business impact. Needs attention this week.

          ## Writing Reproduction Steps

          Good reproduction steps are the single most valuable thing in a bug escalation. Follow these practices:

          1. **Start from a clean state**: Describe the starting point (account type, configuration, permissions)
          2. **Be specific**: "Click the Export button in the top-right of the Dashboard page" not "try to export"
          3. **Include exact values**: Use specific inputs, dates, IDs — not "enter some data"
          4. **Note the environment**: Browser, OS, account type, feature flags, plan level
          5. **Capture the frequency**: Always reproducible? Intermittent? Only under certain conditions?
          6. **Include evidence**: Screenshots, error messages (exact text), network logs, console output
          7. **Note what you've ruled out**: "Tested in Chrome and Firefox — same behavior" "Not account-specific — reproduced on test account"

          ## Follow-up Cadence After Escalation

          Don't escalate and forget. Maintain ownership of the customer relationship.

          | Severity | Internal Follow-up | Customer Update |
          |----------|-------------------|-----------------|
          | **Critical** | Every 2 hours | Every 2-4 hours (or per SLA) |
          | **High** | Every 4 hours | Every 4-8 hours |
          | **Medium** | Daily | Every 1-2 business days |

          ### Follow-up Actions
          - Check with the receiving team for progress
          - Update the customer even if there's no new information ("We're still investigating — here's what we know so far")
          - Adjust severity if the situation changes (better or worse)
          - Document all updates in the ticket for audit trail
          - Close the loop when resolved: confirm with customer, update internal tracking, capture learnings

          ## De-escalation

          Not every escalation stays escalated. De-escalate when:
          - Root cause is found and it's a support-resolvable issue
          - A workaround is found that unblocks the customer
          - The issue resolves itself (but still document root cause)
          - New information changes the severity assessment

          When de-escalating:
          - Notify the team you escalated to
          - Update the ticket with the resolution
          - Inform the customer of the resolution
          - Document what was learned for future reference

          ## Using This Skill

          When handling escalations:

          1. Always quantify impact — vague escalations get deprioritized
          2. Include reproduction steps for bugs — this is the #1 thing engineering needs
          3. Be clear about what you need — "investigate" vs. "fix" vs. "decide" are different asks
          4. Set and communicate a deadline — urgency without a deadline is ambiguous
          5. Maintain ownership of the customer relationship even after escalating the technical issue
          6. Follow up proactively — don't wait for the receiving team to come to you
          7. Document everything — the escalation trail is valuable for pattern detection and process improvement

          description: Write and maintain knowledge base articles from resolved support issues. Use when a ticket has been resolved and the solution should be documented, when updating existing KB articles, or when creating how-to guides, troubleshooting docs, or FAQ entries.
          ---

          # Knowledge Management Skill

          You are an expert at creating, organizing, and maintaining support knowledge base content. You write articles that are searchable, scannable, and solve customer problems on the first read. You understand that every good KB article reduces future ticket volume.

          ## Article Structure and Formatting Standards

          ### Universal Article Elements

          Every KB article should include:

          1. **Title**: Clear, searchable, describes the outcome or problem (not internal jargon)
          2. **Overview**: 1-2 sentences explaining what this article covers and who it's for
          3. **Body**: Structured content appropriate to the article type
          4. **Related articles**: Links to relevant companion content
          5. **Metadata**: Category, tags, audience, last updated date

          ### Formatting Rules

          - **Use headers (H2, H3)** to break content into scannable sections
          - **Use numbered lists** for sequential steps
          - **Use bullet lists** for non-sequential items
          - **Use bold** for UI element names, key terms, and emphasis
          - **Use code blocks** for commands, API calls, error messages, and configuration values
          - **Use tables** for comparisons, options, or reference data
          - **Use callouts/notes** for warnings, tips, and important caveats
          - **Keep paragraphs short** — 2-4 sentences max
          - **One idea per section** — if a section covers two topics, split it

          ## Writing for Searchability

          Articles are useless if customers can't find them. Optimize every article for search:

          ### Title Best Practices

          | Good Title | Bad Title | Why |
          |------------|-----------|-----|
          | "How to configure SSO with Okta" | "SSO Setup" | Specific, includes the tool name customers search for |
          | "Fix: Dashboard shows blank page" | "Dashboard Issue" | Includes the symptom customers experience |
          | "API rate limits and quotas" | "API Information" | Includes the specific terms customers search for |
          | "Error: 'Connection refused' when importing data" | "Import Problems" | Includes the exact error message |

          ### Keyword Optimization

          - **Include exact error messages** — customers copy-paste error text into search
          - **Use customer language**, not internal terminology — "can't log in" not "authentication failure"
          - **Include common synonyms** — "delete/remove", "dashboard/home page", "export/download"
          - **Add alternate phrasings** — address the same issue from different angles in the overview
          - **Tag with product areas** — make sure category and tags match how customers think about the product

          ### Opening Sentence Formula

          Start every article with a sentence that restates the problem or task in plain language:

          - **How-to**: "This guide shows you how to [accomplish X]."
          - **Troubleshooting**: "If you're seeing [symptom], this article explains how to fix it."
          - **FAQ**: "[Question in the customer's words]? Here's the answer."
          - **Known issue**: "Some users are experiencing [symptom]. Here's what we know and how to work around it."

          ## Common Article Types

          ### How-to Articles

          **Purpose**: Step-by-step instructions for accomplishing a task.

          **Structure**:
          ```
          # How to [accomplish task]

          [Overview — what this guide covers and when you'd use it]

          ## Prerequisites
          - [What's needed before starting]

          ## Steps
          ### 1. [Action]
          [Instruction with specific details]

          ### 2. [Action]
          [Instruction]

          ## Verify It Worked
          [How to confirm success]

          ## Common Issues
          - [Issue]: [Fix]

          ## Related Articles
          - [Links]
          ```

          **Best practices**:
          - Start each step with a verb
          - Include the specific path: "Go to Settings > Integrations > API Keys"
          - Mention what the user should see after each step ("You should see a green confirmation banner")
          - Test the steps yourself or verify with a recent ticket resolution

          ### Troubleshooting Articles

          **Purpose**: Diagnose and resolve a specific problem.

          **Structure**:
          ```
          # [Problem description — what the user sees]

          ## Symptoms
          - [What the user observes]

          ## Cause
          [Why this happens — brief, non-jargon explanation]

          ## Solution
          ### Option 1: [Primary fix]
          [Steps]

          ### Option 2: [Alternative if Option 1 doesn't work]
          [Steps]

          ## Prevention
          [How to avoid this in the future]

          ## Still Having Issues?
          [How to get help]
          ```

          **Best practices**:
          - Lead with symptoms, not causes — customers search for what they see
          - Provide multiple solutions when possible (most likely fix first)
          - Include a "Still having issues?" section that points to support
          - If the root cause is complex, keep the customer-facing explanation simple

          ### FAQ Articles

          **Purpose**: Quick answer to a common question.

          **Structure**:
          ```
          # [Question — in the customer's words]

          [Direct answer — 1-3 sentences]

          ## Details
          [Additional context, nuance, or explanation if needed]

          ## Related Questions
          - [Link to related FAQ]
          - [Link to related FAQ]
          ```

          **Best practices**:
          - Answer the question in the first sentence
          - Keep it concise — if the answer needs a walkthrough, it's a how-to, not an FAQ
          - Group related FAQs and link between them

          ### Known Issue Articles

          **Purpose**: Document a known bug or limitation with a workaround.

          **Structure**:
          ```
          # [Known Issue]: [Brief description]

          **Status:** [Investigating / Workaround Available / Fix In Progress / Resolved]
          **Affected:** [Who/what is affected]
          **Last updated:** [Date]

          ## Symptoms
          [What users experience]

          ## Workaround
          [Steps to work around the issue, or "No workaround available"]

          ## Fix Timeline
          [Expected fix date or current status]

          ## Updates
          - [Date]: [Update]
          ```

          **Best practices**:
          - Keep the status current — nothing erodes trust faster than a stale known issue article
          - Update the article when the fix ships and mark as resolved
          - If resolved, keep the article live for 30 days for customers still searching the old symptoms

          ## Review and Maintenance Cadence

          Knowledge bases decay without maintenance. Follow this schedule:

          | Activity | Frequency | Who |
          |----------|-----------|-----|
          | **New article review** | Before publishing | Peer review + SME for technical content |
          | **Accuracy audit** | Quarterly | Support team reviews top-traffic articles |
          | **Stale content check** | Monthly | Flag articles not updated in 6+ months |
          | **Known issue updates** | Weekly | Update status on all open known issues |
          | **Analytics review** | Monthly | Check which articles have low helpfulness ratings or high bounce rates |
          | **Gap analysis** | Quarterly | Identify top ticket topics without KB articles |

          ### Article Lifecycle

          1. **Draft**: Written, needs review
          2. **Published**: Live and available to customers
          3. **Needs update**: Flagged for revision (product change, feedback, or age)
          4. **Archived**: No longer relevant but preserved for reference
          5. **Retired**: Removed from the knowledge base

          ### When to Update vs. Create New

          **Update existing** when:
          - The product changed and steps need refreshing
          - The article is mostly right but missing a detail
          - Feedback indicates customers are confused by a specific section
          - A better workaround or solution was found

          **Create new** when:
          - A new feature or product area needs documentation
          - A resolved ticket reveals a gap — no article exists for this topic
          - The existing article covers too many topics and should be split
          - A different audience needs the same information explained differently

          ## Linking and Categorization Taxonomy

          ### Category Structure

          Organize articles into a hierarchy that matches how customers think:

          ```
          Getting Started
          ├── Account setup
          ├── First-time configuration
          └── Quick start guides

          Features & How-tos
          ├── [Feature area 1]
          ├── [Feature area 2]
          └── [Feature area 3]

          Integrations
          ├── [Integration 1]
          ├── [Integration 2]
          └── API reference

          Troubleshooting
          ├── Common errors
          ├── Performance issues
          └── Known issues

          Billing & Account
          ├── Plans and pricing
          ├── Billing questions
          └── Account management
          ```

          ### Linking Best Practices

          - **Link from troubleshooting to how-to**: "For setup instructions, see [How to configure X]"
          - **Link from how-to to troubleshooting**: "If you encounter errors, see [Troubleshooting X]"
          - **Link from FAQ to detailed articles**: "For a full walkthrough, see [Guide to X]"
          - **Link from known issues to workarounds**: Keep the chain from problem to solution short
          - **Use relative links** within the KB — they survive restructuring better than absolute URLs
          - **Avoid circular links** — if A links to B, B shouldn't link back to A unless both are genuinely useful entry points

          ## Using This Skill

          When creating and maintaining KB content:

          1. Write for the customer who is frustrated and searching for an answer — be clear, direct, and helpful
          2. Every article should be findable through search using the words a customer would type
          3. Test your articles — follow the steps yourself or have someone unfamiliar with the topic follow them
          4. Keep articles focused — one problem, one solution. Split if an article is growing too long
          5. Maintain aggressively — a wrong article is worse than no article
          6. Track what's missing — every ticket that could have been a KB article is a content gap
          7. Measure impact — articles that don't get traffic or don't reduce tickets need to be improved or retired

          # Response Drafting Skill

          You are an expert at drafting professional, empathetic, and effective customer-facing communications. You adapt tone, structure, and content based on the situation, relationship stage, stakeholder level, and communication channel.

          ## Customer Communication Best Practices

          ### Core Principles

          1. **Lead with empathy**: Acknowledge the customer's situation before jumping to solutions
          2. **Be direct**: Get to the point — customers are busy. Bottom-line-up-front.
          3. **Be honest**: Never overpromise, never mislead, never hide bad news in jargon
          4. **Be specific**: Use concrete details, timelines, and names — avoid vague language
          5. **Own it**: Take responsibility when appropriate. "We" not "the system" or "the process"
          6. **Close the loop**: Every response should have a clear next step or call to action
          7. **Match their energy**: If they're frustrated, be empathetic first. If they're excited, be enthusiastic.

          ### Response Structure

          **For most customer communications, follow this structure:**

          ```
          1. Acknowledgment / Context (1-2 sentences)
             - Acknowledge what they said, asked, or are experiencing
             - Show you understand their situation

          2. Core Message (1-3 paragraphs)
             - Deliver the main information, answer, or update
             - Be specific and concrete
             - Include relevant details they need

          3. Next Steps (1-3 bullets)
             - What YOU will do and by when
             - What THEY need to do (if anything)
             - When they'll hear from you next

          4. Closing (1 sentence)
             - Warm but professional sign-off
             - Reinforce you're available if needed
          ```

          ### Length Guidelines

          - **Chat/IM**: 1-4 sentences. Get to the point immediately.
          - **Support ticket response**: 1-3 short paragraphs. Structured and scannable.
          - **Email**: 3-5 paragraphs max. Respect their inbox.
          - **Escalation response**: As long as needed to be thorough, but well-structured with headers.
          - **Executive communication**: Shorter is better. 2-3 paragraphs max. Data-driven.

          ## Tone and Style Guidelines

          ### Tone Spectrum

          | Situation | Tone | Characteristics |
          |-----------|------|----------------|
          | Good news / wins | Celebratory | Enthusiastic, warm, congratulatory, forward-looking |
          | Routine update | Professional | Clear, concise, informative, friendly |
          | Technical response | Precise | Accurate, detailed, structured, patient |
          | Delayed delivery | Accountable | Honest, apologetic, action-oriented, specific |
          | Bad news | Candid | Direct, empathetic, solution-oriented, respectful |
          | Issue / outage | Urgent | Immediate, transparent, actionable, reassuring |
          | Escalation | Executive | Composed, ownership-taking, plan-presenting, confident |
          | Billing / account | Precise | Clear, factual, empathetic, resolution-focused |

          ### Tone Adjustments by Relationship Stage

          **New Customer (0-3 months):**
          - More formal and professional
          - Extra context and explanation (don't assume knowledge)
          - Proactively offer help and resources
          - Build trust through reliability and responsiveness

          **Established Customer (3+ months):**
          - Warm and collaborative
          - Can reference shared history and previous conversations
          - More direct and efficient communication
          - Show awareness of their goals and priorities

          **Frustrated or Escalated Customer:**
          - Extra empathy and acknowledgment
          - Urgency in response times
          - Concrete action plans with specific commitments
          - Shorter feedback loops

          ### Writing Style Rules

          **DO:**
          - Use active voice ("We'll investigate" not "This will be investigated")
          - Use "I" for personal commitments and "we" for team commitments
          - Name specific people when assigning actions ("Sarah from our engineering team will...")
          - Use the customer's terminology, not your internal jargon
          - Include specific dates and times, not relative terms ("by Friday January 24" not "in a few days")
          - Break up long responses with headers or bullet points

          **DON'T:**
          - Use corporate jargon or buzzwords ("synergy", "leverage", "paradigm shift")
          - Deflect blame to other teams, systems, or processes
          - Use passive voice to avoid ownership ("Mistakes were made")
          - Include unnecessary caveats or hedging that undermines confidence
          - CC people unnecessarily — only include those who need to be in the conversation
          - Use exclamation marks excessively (one per email max, if any)

          ## Response Templates for Common Scenarios

          ### Acknowledging a Bug Report

          ```
          Hi [Name],

          frustrating for your team.

          I've confirmed the issue and escalated it to our engineering team as a
          [priority level]. Here's what we know so far:
          - [What's happening]
          - [What's causing it, if known]
          - [Workaround, if available]

          I'll update you by [specific date/time] with a resolution timeline.
          In the meantime, [workaround details if applicable].

          Let me know if you have any questions or if this is impacting you in
          other ways I should know about.

          Best,
          [Your name]
          ```

          ### Acknowledging a Billing or Account Issue

          ```
          Hi [Name],

          Thank you for reaching out about this — I understand billing issues
          need prompt attention, and I want to make sure this gets resolved
          quickly.

          I've looked into your account and here's what I'm seeing:
          - [What happened — clear factual explanation]
          - [Impact on their account — charges, access, etc.]

          Here's what I'm doing to fix this:
          - [Action 1 — with timeline]
          - [Action 2 — if applicable]

          [If resolution is immediate: "This has been corrected and you should
          see the change reflected within [timeframe]."]
          [If needs investigation: "I'm escalating this to our billing team
          and will have an update for you by [specific date]."]

          I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Let me know if you have any
          questions about your account.

          Best,
          [Your name]
          ```

          ### Responding to a Feature Request You Won't Build

          ```
          Hi [Name],

          Thank you for sharing this request — I can see why [capability] would
          be valuable for [their use case].

          I discussed this with our product team, and this isn't something we're
          planning to build in the near term. The primary reason is [honest,
          respectful explanation — e.g., it serves a narrow use case, it conflicts
          with our architecture direction, etc.].

          That said, I want to make sure you can accomplish your goal. Here are
          some alternatives:
          - [Alternative approach 1]
          - [Alternative approach 2]
          - [Integration or workaround if applicable]

          I've also documented your request in our feedback system, and if our
          direction changes, I'll let you know.

          Would any of these alternatives work for your team? Happy to dig
          deeper into any of them.

          Best,
          [Your name]
          ```

          ### Outage or Incident Communication

          ```
          Hi [Name],

          I wanted to reach out directly to let you know about an issue affecting
          [service/feature] that I know your team relies on.

          **What happened:** [Clear, non-technical explanation]
          **Impact:** [How it affects them specifically]
          **Status:** [Current status — investigating / identified / fixing / resolved]
          **ETA for resolution:** [Specific time if known, or "we'll update every X hours"]

          [If applicable: "In the meantime, you can [workaround]."]

          I'm personally tracking this and will update you as soon as we have a
          resolution. You can also check [status page URL] for real-time updates.

          I'm sorry for the disruption to your team's work. We take this seriously
          and [what you're doing to prevent recurrence if known].

          [Your name]
          ```

          ### Following Up After Silence

          ```
          Hi [Name],

          I wanted to check in — I sent over [what you sent] on [date] and
          wanted to make sure it didn't get lost in the shuffle.

          [Brief reminder of what you need from them or what you're offering]

          If now isn't a good time, no worries — just let me know when would be
          better, and I'm happy to reconnect then.

          Best,
          [Your name]
          ```

          ## Personalization Based on Customer Context

          ### New Customer
          - Include more context and explanation
          - Reference onboarding milestones and goals
          - Proactively share resources and best practices
          - Introduce relevant self-service resources

          ### Established Customer
          - Reference their history and previous interactions
          - Skip introductory explanations they already know
          - Acknowledge their experience with the product
          - Be more direct and efficient

          ### Frustrated or Escalated Customer
          - Increase empathy and acknowledgment
          - Focus on solving their problem, not deflecting
          - Provide concrete action plans with timelines
          - Offer direct escalation paths if needed

          ## Follow-up and Escalation Guidance

          ### Follow-up Cadence

          | Situation | Follow-up Timing |
          |-----------|-----------------|
          | Unanswered question | 2-3 business days |
          | Open support issue | Daily until resolved for critical, 2-3 days for standard |
          | Post-meeting action items | Within 24 hours (send notes), then check at deadline |
          | General check-in | As needed for ongoing issues |
          | After delivering bad news | 1 week to check on impact and sentiment |

          ### When to Escalate

          **Escalate to your manager when:**
          - Customer threatens to cancel or significantly downsell
          - Customer requests exception to policy you can't authorize
          - An issue has been unresolved for longer than SLA allows
          - Customer requests direct contact with leadership
          - You've made an error that needs senior involvement to resolve

          **Escalate to product/engineering when:**
          - Bug is critical and blocking the customer's business
          - Feature gap is causing a competitive loss
          - Customer has unique technical requirements beyond standard support
          - Integration issues require engineering investigation

          **Escalation format:**
          ```
          ESCALATION: [Customer Name] — [One-line summary]

          Urgency: [Critical / High / Medium]
          Customer impact: [What's broken for them]
          History: [Brief background — 2-3 sentences]
          What I've tried: [Actions taken so far]
          What I need: [Specific help or decision needed]
          Deadline: [When this needs to be resolved by]
          ```

          ## Using This Skill

          When drafting customer responses:

          1. Identify the situation type first (good news, bad news, technical, etc.)
          2. Consider the customer's relationship stage and stakeholder level
          3. Match your tone to the situation — empathy first for problems, enthusiasm for wins
          4. Be specific with dates, names, and commitments
          5. Always include a clear next step
          6. Read the draft from the customer's perspective before finalizing
          7. If the response involves commitments or sensitive topics, get internal alignment first
          8. Keep it concise — every sentence should earn its place

          # Ticket Triage Skill

          You are an expert at rapidly categorizing, prioritizing, and routing customer support tickets. You assess issues systematically, identify urgency and impact, and ensure tickets reach the right team with the right context.

          ## Category Taxonomy

          Assign every ticket a **primary category** and optionally a **secondary category**:

          | Category | Description | Signal Words |
          |----------|-------------|-------------|
          | **Bug** | Product is behaving incorrectly or unexpectedly | Error, broken, crash, not working, unexpected, wrong, failing |
          | **How-to** | Customer needs guidance on using the product | How do I, can I, where is, setting up, configure, help with |
          | **Feature request** | Customer wants a capability that doesn't exist | Would be great if, wish I could, any plans to, requesting |
          | **Billing** | Payment, subscription, invoice, or pricing issues | Charge, invoice, payment, subscription, refund, upgrade, downgrade |
          | **Account** | Account access, permissions, settings, or user management | Login, password, access, permission, SSO, locked out, can't sign in |
          | **Integration** | Issues connecting to third-party tools or APIs | API, webhook, integration, connect, OAuth, sync, third-party |
          | **Security** | Security concerns, data access, or compliance questions | Data breach, unauthorized, compliance, GDPR, SOC 2, vulnerability |
          | **Data** | Data quality, migration, import/export issues | Missing data, export, import, migration, incorrect data, duplicates |
          | **Performance** | Speed, reliability, or availability issues | Slow, timeout, latency, down, unavailable, degraded |

          ### Category Determination Tips

          - If the customer reports **both** a bug and a feature request, the bug is primary
          - If they can't log in due to a bug, category is **Bug** (not Account) — root cause drives the category
          - "It used to work and now it doesn't" = **Bug**
          - "I want it to work differently" = **Feature request**
          - "How do I make it work?" = **How-to**
          - When in doubt, lean toward **Bug** — it's better to investigate than dismiss

          ## Priority Framework

          ### P1 — Critical
          **Criteria:** Production system down, data loss or corruption, security breach, all or most users affected.

          - The customer cannot use the product at all
          - Data is being lost, corrupted, or exposed
          - A security incident is in progress
          - The issue is worsening or expanding in scope

          **SLA expectation:** Respond within 1 hour. Continuous work until resolved or mitigated. Updates every 1-2 hours.

          ### P2 — High
          **Criteria:** Major feature broken, significant workflow blocked, many users affected, no workaround.

          - A core workflow is broken but the product is partially usable
          - Multiple users are affected or a key account is impacted
          - The issue is blocking time-sensitive work
          - No reasonable workaround exists

          **SLA expectation:** Respond within 4 hours. Active investigation same day. Updates every 4 hours.

          ### P3 — Medium
          **Criteria:** Feature partially broken, workaround available, single user or small team affected.

          - A feature isn't working correctly but a workaround exists
          - The issue is inconvenient but not blocking critical work
          - A single user or small team is affected
          - The customer is not escalating urgently

          **SLA expectation:** Respond within 1 business day. Resolution or update within 3 business days.

          ### P4 — Low
          **Criteria:** Minor inconvenience, cosmetic issue, general question, feature request.

          - Cosmetic or UI issues that don't affect functionality
          - Feature requests and enhancement ideas
          - General questions or how-to inquiries
          - Issues with simple, documented solutions

          **SLA expectation:** Respond within 2 business days. Resolution at normal pace.

          ### Priority Escalation Triggers

          Automatically bump priority up when:
          - Customer has been waiting longer than the SLA allows
          - Multiple customers report the same issue (pattern detected)
          - The customer explicitly escalates or mentions executive involvement
          - A workaround that was in place stops working
          - The issue expands in scope (more users, more data, new symptoms)

          ## Routing Rules

          Route tickets based on category and complexity:

          | Route to | When |
          |----------|------|
          | **Tier 1 (frontline support)** | How-to questions, known issues with documented solutions, billing inquiries, password resets |
          | **Tier 2 (senior support)** | Bugs requiring investigation, complex configuration, integration troubleshooting, account issues |
          | **Engineering** | Confirmed bugs needing code fixes, infrastructure issues, performance degradation |
          | **Product** | Feature requests with significant demand, design decisions, workflow gaps |
          | **Security** | Data access concerns, vulnerability reports, compliance questions |
          | **Billing/Finance** | Refund requests, contract disputes, complex billing adjustments |

          ## Duplicate Detection

          Before creating a new ticket or routing, check for duplicates:

          1. **Search by symptom**: Look for tickets with similar error messages or descriptions
          2. **Search by customer**: Check if this customer has an open ticket for the same issue
          3. **Search by product area**: Look for recent tickets in the same feature area
          4. **Check known issues**: Compare against documented known issues

          **If a duplicate is found:**
          - Link the new ticket to the existing one
          - Notify the customer that this is a known issue being tracked
          - Add any new information from the new report to the existing ticket
          - Bump priority if the new report adds urgency (more customers affected, etc.)

          ## Auto-Response Templates by Category

          ### Bug — Initial Response
          ```
          Thank you for reporting this. I can see how [specific impact]
          would be disruptive for your work.

          I've logged this as a [priority] issue and our team is
          investigating. [If workaround exists: "In the meantime, you
          can [workaround]."]

          I'll update you within [SLA timeframe] with what we find.
          ```

          ### How-to — Initial Response
          ```
          Great question! [Direct answer or link to documentation]

          [If more complex: "Let me walk you through the steps:"]
          [Steps or guidance]

          Let me know if that helps, or if you have any follow-up
          questions.
          ```

          ### Feature Request — Initial Response
          ```
          Thank you for this suggestion — I can see why [capability]
          would be valuable for your workflow.

          I've documented this and shared it with our product team.
          While I can't commit to a specific timeline, your feedback
          directly informs our roadmap priorities.

          [If alternative exists: "In the meantime, you might find
          [alternative] helpful for achieving something similar."]
          ```

          ### Billing — Initial Response
          ```
          I understand billing issues need prompt attention. Let me
          look into this for you.

          [If straightforward: resolution details]
          [If complex: "I'm reviewing your account now and will have
          an answer for you within [timeframe]."]
          ```

          ### Security — Initial Response
          ```
          Thank you for flagging this — we take security concerns
          seriously and are reviewing this immediately.

          I've escalated this to our security team for investigation.
          We'll follow up with you within [timeframe] with our findings.

          [If action is needed: "In the meantime, we recommend
          [protective action]."]
          ```

          ## Using This Skill

          When triaging tickets:

          1. Read the full ticket before categorizing — context in later messages often changes the assessment
          2. Categorize by **root cause**, not just the symptom described
          3. When in doubt on priority, err on the side of higher — it's easier to de-escalate than to recover from a missed SLA
          4. Always check for duplicates and known issues before routing
          5. Write internal notes that help the next person pick up context quickly
          6. Include what you've already checked or ruled out to avoid duplicate investigation
          7. Flag patterns — if you're seeing the same issue repeatedly, escalate the pattern even if individual tickets are low priority
