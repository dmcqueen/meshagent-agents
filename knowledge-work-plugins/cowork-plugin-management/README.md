# Claude Cowork Plugin Management

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's cowork plugin management knowledge work plugin

## Description

This agent helps teams design, organize, and refine plugins for knowledge work agents so they are consistent, maintainable, and aligned with project goals. Users can plan and structure plugin workflows, map out required commands and skills, and produce clear implementation guidance and documentation to support development and handoff. The agent is useful for creating reusable plugin artifacts, improving consistency across plugins, and reducing ambiguity in how agent capabilities are implemented and maintained. It focuses on practical outcomes for teams and developers rather than low-level runtime details.
