# Claude Cowork Plugin Management

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's cowork plugin management knowledge work plugin

## Description

This agent helps teams design, organize, and maintain plugin workflows for knowledge-work assistants, enabling clearer planning of commands, skills, and documentation so plugins remain consistent and maintainable. Users can work through creating or customizing cowork plugins, map out required capabilities, and produce concrete implementation plans and documentation to guide developers. It supports improving the structure and consistency of plugin artifacts and helps translate high-level workflow needs into actionable tasks and specifications. The agent runs as a management assistant focused on plugin workflow and artifact quality rather than executing code or deploying plugins directly.
