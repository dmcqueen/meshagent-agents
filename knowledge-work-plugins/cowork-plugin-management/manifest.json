  "long_description": "This agent helps users and teams design and organize plugin workflows and related artifacts for collaborative knowledge-work agents, enabling clearer planning of commands, skills, and documentation so plugins are more consistent and maintainable. Teams can use it to map out capability designs, prioritize and structure implementation tasks, and produce coherent documentation and specs that guide development and review. It also supports improving consistency across plugin artifacts and offers practical guidance for turning workflow designs into actionable development plans. Brief model/runtime details are only relevant insofar as the agent provides conversational guidance and planning assistance for plugin management.",
