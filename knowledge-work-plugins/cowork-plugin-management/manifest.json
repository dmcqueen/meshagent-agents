  "long_description": "This plugin supports cowork plugin management workflows and is designed to help users complete practical work with less manual effort. It can help design and organize plugin workflows for agent capabilities, guide implementation planning for commands, skills, and docs, and improve consistency and maintainability of plugin artifacts. Built-in guidance and reusable skills help keep outputs consistent, context-aware, and action-oriented. It works well for both quick answers and multi-step tasks that require planning, drafting, and refinement. Teams can use it as a day-to-day assistant for cowork plugin management decisions, analysis, and communication.",
