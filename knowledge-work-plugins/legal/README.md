# Claude Legal

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's legal knowledge work plugin

## Description

This agent helps legal teams and practitioners review and triage legal documents, identifying key obligations, risks, and compliance concerns so users can make informed decisions faster. It can draft, refine, and structure legal-facing language—such as contract clauses, vendor checks, and NDA responses—into clear, actionable drafts ready for human review. The agent also summarizes complex legal materials and prepares concise meeting briefings or response templates to streamline collaboration and reduce review time.
