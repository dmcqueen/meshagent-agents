# Claude Legal

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's legal knowledge work plugin

## Description

This agent helps legal teams and individuals review contracts and other legal texts to surface key obligations, risks, and compliance issues, enabling faster risk triage and clearer negotiation priorities. It can draft and refine legal-facing language and templated responses so teams produce consistent, structured documents and communications. The agent also summarizes complex legal materials into practical guidance for stakeholders and prepares concise meeting briefs or vendor checks to inform decision-making. Workflows supported include contract review, NDA triage, legal-risk assessment, and creating canned responses for routine legal matters.
