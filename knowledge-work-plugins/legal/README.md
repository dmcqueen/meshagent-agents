## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's legal knowledge work plugin

## Description

This agent helps legal teams and professionals review and manage legal content by identifying key obligations, risks, and compliance concerns within contracts and NDAs, enabling faster prioritization and triage of documents. Teams can use it to draft and refine legal-facing language with clear structure for meetings, vendor checks, and other communications, producing concise summaries and practical guidance that support decision-making. It streamlines routine legal tasks—like contract review, risk assessment, and preparing briefing materials—so users can focus on higher-value legal judgment. The agent runs as a conversational assistant that guides users through review workflows and generates editable drafts and briefing notes for immediate use.
