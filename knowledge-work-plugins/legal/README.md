# Claude Legal

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's legal knowledge work plugin

## Description

This agent helps legal teams and non-lawyer stakeholders quickly review and triage legal documents, surfacing key obligations, risks, and action items to inform decision-making. It can draft and refine legal-facing language—such as contract clauses, response templates, and briefing notes—into clear, structured text suitable for negotiation or compliance workflows. The agent also summarizes complex legal materials into practical guidance and creates concise meeting briefs or triage assessments (for example for NDAs and vendor checks) to accelerate reviews and reduce turnaround time. Used as part of a review workflow, it supports consistent, repeatable outputs that help teams move from legal analysis to concrete next steps.
