  "long_description": "This plugin supports legal workflows and is designed to help users complete practical work with less manual effort. It can review legal text and surface key obligations or risks, draft and refine legal-facing language with clear structure, and summarize complex legal material into practical guidance. Built-in guidance and reusable skills help keep outputs consistent, context-aware, and action-oriented. It works well for both quick answers and multi-step tasks that require planning, drafting, and refinement. Teams can use it as a day-to-day assistant for legal decisions, analysis, and communication.",
