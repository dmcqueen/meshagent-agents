It can shape product requirements and prioritize roadmap decisions, synthesize user feedback into actionable product insights, and draft product docs for planning, alignment, and execution. Built-in guidance and reusable skills help keep outputs consistent, context-aware, and action-oriented. It works well for both quick answers and multi-step tasks that require planning, drafting, and refinement. Teams can use it as a day-to-day assistant for product management decisions, analysis, and communication.",
