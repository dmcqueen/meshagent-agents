  "long_description": "This agent helps product teams turn research, feedback, and data into clear, actionable outcomes: it synthesizes user research and competitive inputs into prioritized requirements, drafts feature specs and metrics for execution, and recommends roadmap adjustments to align with stakeholder priorities. Teams can use it to produce concise competitive briefs, measurable metrics reviews, and stakeholder-ready updates that accelerate decision-making and reduce ambiguity. It also generates draft documentation for planning and handoff, improving alignment between PMs, engineers, and other stakeholders. When connected to an appropriate model runtime, it can streamline recurring product workflows and reporting.",
