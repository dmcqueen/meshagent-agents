  "long_description": "This agent helps product teams turn research and feedback into clear, prioritized work by synthesizing user insights, drafting feature specifications, and shaping roadmap decisions to align stakeholders and measurable outcomes. Teams can use it to produce competitive briefs, define metrics and success criteria, update roadmaps, and create stakeholder communications that keep planning and execution coordinated. It supports recurring review workflows like metrics tracking and research synthesis so teams maintain momentum and make data-informed tradeoffs. Lightweight model/runtime details are abstracted away, letting teams focus on producing actionable product artifacts.",
