# Claude Marketing

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's marketing knowledge work plugin

## Description

This agent helps marketing teams generate and refine campaign concepts, craft message variants for different audiences, and plan content and channel strategies aligned to clear goals so teams can move quickly from idea to execution. Users can get polished drafts for emails, ad copy, and other content, plus guidance to ensure brand voice, positioning, and consistency across materials. It also supports competitive analysis, SEO review, and performance-oriented reporting to help prioritize tactics and measure outcomes. The agent is intended for collaborative marketing work—ideation, content production, and performance planning—rather than technical deployment tasks.
