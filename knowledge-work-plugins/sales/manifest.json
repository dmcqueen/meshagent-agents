It can prepare prospecting and account messaging tailored to context, summarize customer signals to support deal strategy, and generate materials for outreach, qualification, and follow-up. Built-in guidance and reusable skills help keep outputs consistent, context-aware, and action-oriented. It works well for both quick answers and multi-step tasks that require planning, drafting, and refinement. Teams can use it as a day-to-day assistant for sales decisions, analysis, and communication.",
