This agent helps customer support teams triage incoming issues, prioritize urgent cases, and move tickets toward resolution through clear, empathetic response drafts and suggested next steps. Teams can use it to generate follow-up messages, propose escalations when needed, and create or update knowledge-base content to reduce repeat inquiries.
