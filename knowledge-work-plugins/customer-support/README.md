# Claude Customer Support

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's customer support knowledge work plugin

## Description

This agent helps customer support teams triage incoming issues, prioritize urgent cases, and move tickets toward timely resolution by proposing clear next steps. It drafts empathetic, professional responses and follow-up messages that agents can adapt and send, and it can outline escalation paths when problems require higher-level attention. Teams can also use it to summarize research, produce knowledge-base articles, and capture insights that improve future support workflows. By streamlining triage, response drafting, and knowledge management, the agent reduces resolution time and improves consistency in customer communications.
