# Claude Customer Support

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's customer support knowledge work plugin

## Description

This agent helps customer support teams triage incoming tickets, prioritize urgent cases, and move issues toward timely resolution by proposing clear next steps and escalation paths. It can draft empathetic, professional responses and follow-up messages tailored to customer context, and generate concise knowledge-base articles or research summaries to capture institutional knowledge. Teams can use the agent to streamline escalation decisions, reduce response times, and improve consistency across support communications. When connected to a compatible runtime, it operates as an interactive assistant for support workflows without replacing human judgment.
