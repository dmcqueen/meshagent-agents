  "long_description": "This agent enables customer support teams to triage incoming issues, prioritize urgent cases, and move tickets efficiently toward resolution by proposing clear next steps and escalation paths; teams can use it to quickly assess problem severity and assign appropriate follow-up actions. It helps draft clear, empathetic responses and follow-up messages tailored to each case, and can produce knowledge-base articles or research summaries to capture recurring issues and improve long-term support. Users can escalate complex cases with suggested rationale and context, maintain better knowledge management, and reduce resolution times through consistent, well-structured communication. The agent is intended for practical customer-support workflows and collaboration, producing outputs that support faster, more organized ticket handling.",
