  "long_description": "This agent helps customer support teams triage incoming issues, prioritize urgent cases, and move tickets toward timely resolution by proposing clear next steps. It drafts empathetic, professional responses and follow-up messages that agents can adapt and send, and it can outline escalation paths when problems require higher-level attention. Teams can also use it to summarize research, produce knowledge-base articles, and capture insights that improve future support workflows. By streamlining triage, response drafting, and knowledge management, the agent reduces resolution time and improves consistency in customer communications.",
