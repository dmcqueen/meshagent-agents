  "long_description": "This agent helps research teams explore biomedical topics, synthesize scientific context into concise, usable summaries, and support hypothesis framing and evidence-oriented analysis to advance project decisions. Users can request focused reviews of single-cell and related experimental workflows, get guidance on problem selection and QC considerations, and obtain practical next steps for data-processing pipelines and analysis tools. The agent is oriented to produce clear, research-ready summaries and actionable suggestions that facilitate experiment planning, data interpretation, and collaborative decision making. It operates with models suited to bio-research tasks to keep responses domain-relevant and evidence-focused.",
