  "long_description": "This agent helps researchers and teams explore biomedical topics, synthesize scientific context, and produce clear, usable summaries that support decision-making in research projects. It assists with framing research questions and hypotheses, performing evidence-oriented analysis, and translating technical findings\u2014such as single-cell RNA quality control and computational tool workflows\u2014into actionable next steps. Users can rely on it to prioritize experimental or computational tasks, design reproducible analysis plans, and communicate results to collaborators. The agent is intended to streamline research planning and interpretation rather than replace domain expertise.",
