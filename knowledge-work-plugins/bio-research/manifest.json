  "description": "An agent that uses Anthropic's bio research knowledge work plugin",
  "long_description": "This agent helps research teams explore biomedical topics, synthesize scientific context into concise, usable summaries, and support evidence-oriented hypothesis framing to guide experimental planning and analysis. Users can employ it to distill complex literature and instrument-derived data into clear takeaways, identify promising scientific problems, and prioritize next steps for single-cell RNA workflows or related computational pipelines. It also assists with practical development tasks such as designing analysis approaches and refining reproducible workflows so teams can move from exploratory questions to actionable experiments and analyses. The agent is tailored for bio research use cases and focuses on producing focused, evidence-backed outputs to inform decisions.",
