# Claude Bio Research

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's bio research knowledge work plugin

## Description

This agent helps research teams explore biomedical topics and convert complex scientific literature and data context into concise, actionable summaries that support decision-making. Users can run focused literature syntheses, frame testable hypotheses, and produce evidence-oriented analyses to guide experimental design or computational workflows. It also assists with practical research tasks such as selecting scientific problems, planning single-cell RNA quality-control and analysis steps, and aligning instrument data with standardized formats to improve reproducibility. Brief model-driven guidance helps translate domain knowledge into clear next steps and deliverables for research projects.
