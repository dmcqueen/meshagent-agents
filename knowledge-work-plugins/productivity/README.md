# Claude Productivity

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's productivity knowledge work plugin

## Description

This plugin supports productivity workflows and is designed to help users complete practical work with less manual effort. It can turn rough requests into structured plans and deliverables, summarize context and extract clear next actions, and support day-to-day execution across writing, planning, and decision support. Built-in guidance and reusable skills help keep outputs consistent, context-aware, and action-oriented. It works well for both quick answers and multi-step tasks that require planning, drafting, and refinement. Teams can use it as a day-to-day assistant for productivity decisions, analysis, and communication.
