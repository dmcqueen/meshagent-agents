  "long_description": "This plugin supports finance workflows and is designed to help users complete practical work with less manual effort. It can analyze financial questions and explain implications clearly, summarize reports and highlight the most decision-relevant signals, and prepare structured outputs for planning, review, and stakeholder updates. Built-in guidance and reusable skills help keep outputs consistent, context-aware, and action-oriented. It works well for both quick answers and multi-step tasks that require planning, drafting, and refinement. Teams can use it as a day-to-day assistant for finance decisions, analysis, and communication.",
