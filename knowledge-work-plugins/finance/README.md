# Claude Finance

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's finance knowledge work plugin

## Description

This agent helps finance teams and analysts analyze financial questions, summarize reports, and extract the decision-relevant signals needed for planning, reviews, and stakeholder updates. It can prepare structured outputs such as reconciliations, journal-entry drafts, variance analyses, and audit-support materials to speed close management and testing activities. Users can rely on it to clarify implications of statements and recommend next steps for month-end, SOX testing, and reconciliation workflows. The agent’s outputs are designed to reduce review time and make financial issues and remediation actions clear and actionable.
