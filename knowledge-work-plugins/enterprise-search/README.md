# Claude Enterprise Search

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's enterprise search knowledge work plugin

## Description

This agent lets teams quickly locate and synthesize relevant internal information from large enterprise knowledge sources so they can make faster, better-informed decisions. Users can run focused searches, gather and compare evidence from multiple documents, and receive concise, decision-ready summaries that directly reference the underlying content. It also supports designing search strategies and managing which sources are consulted, helping reduce time spent hunting for context and increasing confidence in answers to complex, context-rich questions. The agent is intended for practical knowledge work workflows where grounded, source-backed responses and clear synthesis are the primary outcomes.
