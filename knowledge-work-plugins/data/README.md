# Claude Data

## Summary

An agent that uses Anthropic's data knowledge work plugin

## Description

This agent helps users and teams turn data questions into clear, actionable analytical work by guiding the process from exploration and validation through statistical analysis and concise interpretation. Users can ask it to extract context from datasets, generate and refine SQL queries, perform data validation and statistical checks, and produce visualizations or interactive dashboard designs to communicate findings. It is useful for structuring reproducible analytical workflows, ensuring data quality, and creating stakeholder-ready summaries and visual outputs that support decision-making. The agent operates as a conversational assistant focused on data tasks and delivering interpretable results rather than executing infrastructure-level operations.
