It can analyze data-related questions and interpret findings clearly, help structure analytical workflows from question to conclusion, and produce concise explanations and summaries for stakeholders. Built-in guidance and reusable skills help keep outputs consistent, context-aware, and action-oriented. It works well for both quick answers and multi-step tasks that require planning, drafting, and refinement. Teams can use it as a day-to-day assistant for data decisions, analysis, and communication.",
