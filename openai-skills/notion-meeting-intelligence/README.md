## Description

This agent helps teams extract actionable insights and next steps from meeting content by answering domain-specific questions, clarifying ambiguous requests into concrete outputs, and tailoring guidance to the user’s goals and constraints. Users can ask it to summarize meeting discussions, identify decisions and action items, and generate follow-up plans or concise briefs that stakeholders can act on.
