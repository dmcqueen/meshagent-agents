          description: "Use when the user explicitly asks for a desktop or system screenshot (full screen, specific app or window, or a pixel region), or when tool-specific capture capabilities are unavailable and an OS-level capture is needed."
          ---
          
          
          # Screenshot Capture
          
          Follow these save-location rules every time:
          
          1) If the user specifies a path, save there.
          2) If the user asks for a screenshot without a path, save to the OS default screenshot location.
          3) If Codex needs a screenshot for its own inspection, save to the temp directory.
          
          ## Tool priority
          
          - Prefer tool-specific screenshot capabilities when available (for example: a Figma MCP/skill for Figma files, or Playwright/agent-browser tools for browsers and Electron apps).
          - Use this skill when explicitly asked, for whole-system desktop captures, or when a tool-specific capture cannot get what you need.
          - Otherwise, treat this skill as the default for desktop apps without a better-integrated capture tool.
          
          ## macOS permission preflight (reduce repeated prompts)
          
          On macOS, run the preflight helper once before window/app capture. It checks
          Screen Recording permission, explains why it is needed, and requests it in one
          place.
          
          The helpers route Swift's module cache to `$TMPDIR/codex-swift-module-cache`
          to avoid extra sandbox module-cache prompts.
          
          ```bash
          bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/ensure_macos_permissions.sh
          ```
          
          To avoid multiple sandbox approval prompts, combine preflight + capture in one
          command when possible:
          
          ```bash
          bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/ensure_macos_permissions.sh && \
          python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --app "Codex"
          ```
          
          For Codex inspection runs, keep the output in temp:
          
          ```bash
          bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/ensure_macos_permissions.sh && \
          python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --app "<App>" --mode temp
          ```
          
          Use the bundled scripts to avoid re-deriving OS-specific commands.
          
          ## macOS and Linux (Python helper)
          
          Run the helper from the repo root:
          
          ```bash
          python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py
          ```
          
          Common patterns:
          
          - Default location (user asked for "a screenshot"):
          
          ```bash
          python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py
          ```
          
          - Temp location (Codex visual check):
          
          ```bash
          python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --mode temp
          ```
          
          - Explicit location (user provided a path or filename):
          
          ```bash
          python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --path output/screen.png
          ```
          
          - App/window capture by app name (macOS only; substring match is OK; captures all matching windows):
          
          ```bash
          python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --app "Codex"
          ```
          
          - Specific window title within an app (macOS only):
          
          ```bash
          python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --app "Codex" --window-name "Settings"
          ```
          
          - List matching window ids before capturing (macOS only):
          
          ```bash
          python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --list-windows --app "Codex"
          ```
          
          - Pixel region (x,y,w,h):
          
          ```bash
          python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --mode temp --region 100,200,800,600
          ```
          
          - Focused/active window (captures only the frontmost window; use `--app` to capture all windows):
          
          ```bash
          python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --mode temp --active-window
          ```
          
          - Specific window id (use --list-windows on macOS to discover ids):
          
          ```bash
          python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --window-id 12345
          ```
          
          The script prints one path per capture. When multiple windows or displays match, it prints multiple paths (one per line) and adds suffixes like `-w<windowId>` or `-d<display>`. View each path sequentially with the image viewer tool, and only manipulate images if needed or requested.
          
          ### Workflow examples
          
          - "Take a look at <App> and tell me what you see": capture to temp, then view each printed path in order.
          
          ```bash
          bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/ensure_macos_permissions.sh && \
          python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --app "<App>" --mode temp
          ```
          
          - "The design from Figma is not matching what is implemented": use a Figma MCP/skill to capture the design first, then capture the running app with this skill (typically to temp) and compare the raw screenshots before any manipulation.
          
          ### Multi-display behavior
          
          - On macOS, full-screen captures save one file per display when multiple monitors are connected.
          - On Linux and Windows, full-screen captures use the virtual desktop (all monitors in one image); use `--region` to isolate a single display when needed.
          
          ### Linux prerequisites and selection logic
          
          The helper automatically selects the first available tool:
          
          1) `scrot`
          2) `gnome-screenshot`
          3) ImageMagick `import`
          
          If none are available, ask the user to install one of them and retry.
          
          Coordinate regions require `scrot` or ImageMagick `import`.
          
          `--app`, `--window-name`, and `--list-windows` are macOS-only. On Linux, use
          `--active-window` or provide `--window-id` when available.
          
          ## Windows (PowerShell helper)
          
          Run the PowerShell helper:
          
          ```powershell
          powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1
          ```
          
          Common patterns:
          
          - Default location:
          
          ```powershell
          powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1
          ```
          
          - Temp location (Codex visual check):
          
          ```powershell
          powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1 -Mode temp
          ```
          
          - Explicit path:
          
          ```powershell
          powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1 -Path "C:\Temp\screen.png"
          ```
          
          - Pixel region (x,y,w,h):
          
          ```powershell
          powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1 -Mode temp -Region 100,200,800,600
          ```
          
          - Active window (ask the user to focus it first):
          
          ```powershell
          powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1 -Mode temp -ActiveWindow
          ```
          
          - Specific window handle (only when provided):
          
          ```powershell
          powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1 -WindowHandle 123456
          ```
          
          ## Direct OS commands (fallbacks)
          
          Use these when you cannot run the helpers.
          
          ### macOS
          
          - Full screen to a specific path:
          
          ```bash
          screencapture -x output/screen.png
          ```
          
          - Pixel region:
          
          ```bash
          screencapture -x -R100,200,800,600 output/region.png
          ```
          
          - Specific window id:
          
          ```bash
          screencapture -x -l12345 output/window.png
          ```
          
          - Interactive selection or window pick:
          
          ```bash
          screencapture -x -i output/interactive.png
          ```
          
          ### Linux
          
          - Full screen:
          
          ```bash
          scrot output/screen.png
          ```
          
          ```bash
          gnome-screenshot -f output/screen.png
          ```
          
          ```bash
          import -window root output/screen.png
          ```
          
          - Pixel region:
          
          ```bash
          scrot -a 100,200,800,600 output/region.png
          ```
          
          ```bash
          import -window root -crop 800x600+100+200 output/region.png
          ```
          
          - Active window:
          
          ```bash
          scrot -u output/window.png
          ```
          
          ```bash
          gnome-screenshot -w -f output/window.png
          ```
          
          ## Error handling
          
          - On macOS, run `bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/ensure_macos_permissions.sh` first to request Screen Recording in one place.
          - If you see "screen capture checks are blocked in the sandbox", "could not create image from display", or Swift `ModuleCache` permission errors in a sandboxed run, rerun the command with escalated permissions.
          - If macOS app/window capture returns no matches, run `--list-windows --app "AppName"` and retry with `--window-id`, and make sure the app is visible on screen.
          - If Linux region/window capture fails, check tool availability with `command -v scrot`, `command -v gnome-screenshot`, and `command -v import`.
          - If saving to the OS default location fails with permission errors in a sandbox, rerun the command with escalated permissions.
          - Always report the saved file path in the response.
