  "description": "An agent that uses OpenAI's imagegen skill and powered by gpt-5.2",
  "long_description": "This agent helps users and teams create clear, actionable image-generation requests and workflows by translating vague or high-level ideas into concrete prompts, guidance, and iterative plans that align with specific goals and constraints. It answers domain-specific questions about image generation and advises on how to refine outputs to meet aesthetic, functional, or project requirements. Teams can use it to coordinate image-focused tasks, produce reproducible prompt strategies, and adapt recommendations to context so outputs are consistent with intended outcomes. The agent runs with an image-generation skill and provides pragmatic, outcome-oriented support rather than low-level implementation instructions.",
