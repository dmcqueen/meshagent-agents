# OpenAI Security Threat Model

## Summary

An agent that uses OpenAI's security-threat-model skill and powered by gpt-5.2

## Description

This agent helps security practitioners and teams convert ambiguous security questions into clear, actionable threat modeling outputs, such as prioritized risks, attack surface analyses, and mitigation recommendations tailored to their goals and constraints. Users can ask domain-specific questions about threat scenarios and receive structured guidance that adapts to their context, helping teams make informed decisions and document security trade-offs. It supports iterative refinement of threat models so teams can move from high-level concerns to concrete next steps for remediation, monitoring, or further analysis. The agent operates as a conversational assistant focused on producing practical security-threat-modeling outcomes rather than general discussion.
