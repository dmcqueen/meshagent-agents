             TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

             1. Definitions.

                "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
                and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

                "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
                the copyright owner that is granting the License.

                "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
                other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
                control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
                "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
                direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
                otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
                outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

                "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
                exercising permissions granted by this License.

                "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
                including but not limited to software source code, documentation
                source, and configuration files.

                "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
                transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
                not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
                and conversions to other media types.

                "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
                Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
                copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
                (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

                "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
                form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
                editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
                represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

                "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
                the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
                to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
                submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                subsequently incorporated within the Work.

             2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

             3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                as of the date such litigation is filed.

             4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                meet the following conditions:

                (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and

                (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and

                (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.

                You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                the conditions stated in this License.

             5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

             6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

             7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

             8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

             9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

          description: "Use when the task requires automating a real browser from the terminal (navigation, form filling, snapshots, screenshots, data extraction, UI-flow debugging) via `playwright-cli` or the bundled wrapper script."
          ---


          # Playwright CLI Skill

          Drive a real browser from the terminal using `playwright-cli`. Prefer the bundled wrapper script so the CLI works even when it is not globally installed.
          Treat this skill as CLI-first automation. Do not pivot to `@playwright/test` unless the user explicitly asks for test files.

          ## Prerequisite check (required)

          Before proposing commands, check whether `npx` is available (the wrapper depends on it):

          ```bash
          command -v npx >/dev/null 2>&1
          ```

          If it is not available, pause and ask the user to install Node.js/npm (which provides `npx`). Provide these steps verbatim:

          ```bash
          # Verify Node/npm are installed
          node --version
          npm --version

          # If missing, install Node.js/npm, then:
          npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
          playwright-cli --help
          ```

          Once `npx` is present, proceed with the wrapper script. A global install of `playwright-cli` is optional.

          ## Skill path (set once)

          ```bash
          export CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
          export PWCLI="$CODEX_HOME/skills/playwright/scripts/playwright_cli.sh"
          ```

          User-scoped skills install under `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (default: `~/.codex/skills`).

          ## Quick start

          Use the wrapper script:

          ```bash
          "$PWCLI" open https://playwright.dev --headed
          "$PWCLI" snapshot
          "$PWCLI" click e15
          "$PWCLI" type "Playwright"
          "$PWCLI" press Enter
          "$PWCLI" screenshot
          ```

          If the user prefers a global install, this is also valid:

          ```bash
          npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
          playwright-cli --help
          ```

          ## Core workflow

          1. Open the page.
          2. Snapshot to get stable element refs.
          3. Interact using refs from the latest snapshot.
          4. Re-snapshot after navigation or significant DOM changes.
          5. Capture artifacts (screenshot, pdf, traces) when useful.

          Minimal loop:

          ```bash
          "$PWCLI" open https://example.com
          "$PWCLI" snapshot
          "$PWCLI" click e3
          "$PWCLI" snapshot
          ```

          ## When to snapshot again

          Snapshot again after:

          - navigation
          - clicking elements that change the UI substantially
          - opening/closing modals or menus
          - tab switches

          Refs can go stale. When a command fails due to a missing ref, snapshot again.

          ## Recommended patterns

          ### Form fill and submit

          ```bash
          "$PWCLI" open https://example.com/form
          "$PWCLI" snapshot
          "$PWCLI" fill e1 "user@example.com"
          "$PWCLI" fill e2 "password123"
          "$PWCLI" click e3
          "$PWCLI" snapshot
          ```

          ### Debug a UI flow with traces

          ```bash
          "$PWCLI" open https://example.com --headed
          "$PWCLI" tracing-start
          # ...interactions...
          "$PWCLI" tracing-stop
          ```

          ### Multi-tab work

          ```bash
          "$PWCLI" tab-new https://example.com
          "$PWCLI" tab-list
          "$PWCLI" tab-select 0
          "$PWCLI" snapshot
          ```

          ## Wrapper script

          The wrapper script uses `npx --package @playwright/cli playwright-cli` so the CLI can run without a global install:

          ```bash
          "$PWCLI" --help
          ```

          Prefer the wrapper unless the repository already standardizes on a global install.

          ## Guardrails

          - Always snapshot before referencing element ids like `e12`.
          - Re-snapshot when refs seem stale.
          - Prefer explicit commands over `eval` and `run-code` unless needed.
          - When you do not have a fresh snapshot, use placeholder refs like `eX` and say why; do not bypass refs with `run-code`.
          - Use `--headed` when a visual check will help.
          - When capturing artifacts in this repo, use `output/playwright/` and avoid introducing new top-level artifact folders.
          - Default to CLI commands and workflows, not Playwright test specs.

          # Playwright CLI Reference

          Use the wrapper script unless the CLI is already installed globally:

          ```bash
          export CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
          export PWCLI="$CODEX_HOME/skills/playwright/scripts/playwright_cli.sh"
          "$PWCLI" --help
          ```

          User-scoped skills install under `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (default: `~/.codex/skills`).

          Optional convenience alias:

          ```bash
          alias pwcli="$PWCLI"
          ```

          ## Core

          ```bash
          pwcli open https://example.com
          pwcli close
          pwcli snapshot
          pwcli click e3
          pwcli dblclick e7
          pwcli type "search terms"
          pwcli press Enter
          pwcli fill e5 "user@example.com"
          pwcli drag e2 e8
          pwcli hover e4
          pwcli select e9 "option-value"
          pwcli upload ./document.pdf
          pwcli check e12
          pwcli uncheck e12
          pwcli eval "document.title"
          pwcli eval "el => el.textContent" e5
          pwcli dialog-accept
          pwcli dialog-accept "confirmation text"
          pwcli dialog-dismiss
          pwcli resize 1920 1080
          ```

          ## Navigation

          ```bash
          pwcli go-back
          pwcli go-forward
          pwcli reload
          ```

          ## Keyboard

          ```bash
          pwcli press Enter
          pwcli press ArrowDown
          pwcli keydown Shift
          pwcli keyup Shift
          ```

          ## Mouse

          ```bash
          pwcli mousemove 150 300
          pwcli mousedown
          pwcli mousedown right
          pwcli mouseup
          pwcli mouseup right
          pwcli mousewheel 0 100
          ```

          ## Save as

          ```bash
          pwcli screenshot
          pwcli screenshot e5
          pwcli pdf
          ```

          ## Tabs

          ```bash
          pwcli tab-list
          pwcli tab-new
          pwcli tab-new https://example.com/page
          pwcli tab-close
          pwcli tab-close 2
          pwcli tab-select 0
          ```

          ## DevTools

          ```bash
          pwcli console
          pwcli console warning
          pwcli network
          pwcli run-code "await page.waitForTimeout(1000)"
          pwcli tracing-start
          pwcli tracing-stop
          ```

          ## Sessions

          Use a named session to isolate work:

          ```bash
          pwcli --session todo open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc
          pwcli --session todo snapshot
          ```

          Or set an environment variable once:

          ```bash
          export PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION=todo
          pwcli open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc
          ```
    - path: /skills/playwright/references/workflows.md
      text: |
          # Playwright CLI Workflows

          Use the wrapper script and snapshot often.
          Assume `PWCLI` is set and `pwcli` is an alias for `"$PWCLI"`.
          In this repo, run commands from `output/playwright/<label>/` to keep artifacts contained.

          ## Standard interaction loop

          ```bash
          pwcli open https://example.com
          pwcli snapshot
          pwcli click e3
          pwcli snapshot
          ```

          ## Form submission

          ```bash
          pwcli open https://example.com/form --headed
          pwcli snapshot
          pwcli fill e1 "user@example.com"
          pwcli fill e2 "password123"
          pwcli click e3
          pwcli snapshot
          pwcli screenshot
          ```

          ## Data extraction

          ```bash
          pwcli open https://example.com
          pwcli snapshot
          pwcli eval "document.title"
          pwcli eval "el => el.textContent" e12
          ```

          ## Debugging and inspection

          Capture console messages and network activity after reproducing an issue:

          ```bash
          pwcli console warning
          pwcli network
          ```

          Record a trace around a suspicious flow:

          ```bash
          pwcli tracing-start
          # reproduce the issue
          pwcli tracing-stop
          pwcli screenshot
          ```

          ## Sessions

          Use sessions to isolate work across projects:

          ```bash
          pwcli --session marketing open https://example.com
          pwcli --session marketing snapshot
          pwcli --session checkout open https://example.com/checkout
          ```

          Or set the session once:

          ```bash
          export PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION=checkout
          pwcli open https://example.com/checkout
          ```

          ## Configuration file

          By default, the CLI reads `playwright-cli.json` from the current directory. Use `--config` to point at a specific file.

          Minimal example:

          ```json
          {
            "browser": {
              "launchOptions": {
                "headless": false
              },
              "contextOptions": {
                "viewport": { "width": 1280, "height": 720 }
              }
            }
          }
          ```

          ## Troubleshooting

          - If an element ref fails, run `pwcli snapshot` again and retry.
          - If the page looks wrong, re-open with `--headed` and resize the window.
          - If a flow depends on prior state, use a named `--session`.
