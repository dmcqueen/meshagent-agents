## Description

This plugin supports spreadsheet workflows and is designed to help users complete practical work with less manual effort. It can answer domain-specific questions in spreadsheet work, turn ambiguous requests into actionable outputs, and adapt guidance to user goals, constraints, and context. Built-in guidance and reusable skills help keep outputs consistent, context-aware, and action-oriented.
