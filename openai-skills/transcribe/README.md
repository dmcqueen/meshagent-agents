# OpenAI Transcribe

## Summary

An agent that uses OpenAI's transcribe skill

## Description

This agent enables teams to transcribe audio and extract structured insights from spoken content, helping turn recordings into searchable text, timestamps, and speaker-separated segments for downstream review or analysis. Users can ask domain-specific questions about transcribed material, request clarifications or edits, and receive actionable outputs that adapt to project goals and constraints. It is designed to streamline workflows around meeting notes, interviews, and voice data by producing clear, usable transcripts and guidance for next steps. The agent operates with a transcription-focused model to handle diarization and related transcription tasks.
