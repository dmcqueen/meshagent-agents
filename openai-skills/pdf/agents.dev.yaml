             "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
             Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
             copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

             "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
             form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
             editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
             represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
             of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
             separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
             the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

             "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

             submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
             or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
             the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

             designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

             "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
             on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
             subsequently incorporated within the Work.

          2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
             publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
             Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                 the Derivative Works; and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
             the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
             and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
             or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
             License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
             on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
             any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

          description: "Use when tasks involve reading, creating, or reviewing PDF files where rendering and layout matter; prefer visual checks by rendering pages (Poppler) and use Python tools such as `reportlab`, `pdfplumber`, and `pypdf` for generation and extraction."
          ---


          # PDF Skill

          ## When to use
          - Read or review PDF content where layout and visuals matter.
          - Create PDFs programmatically with reliable formatting.
          - Validate final rendering before delivery.

          ## Workflow
          1. Prefer visual review: render PDF pages to PNGs and inspect them.
             - Use `pdftoppm` if available.
             - If unavailable, install Poppler or ask the user to review the output locally.
          2. Use `reportlab` to generate PDFs when creating new documents.
          3. Use `pdfplumber` (or `pypdf`) for text extraction and quick checks; do not rely on it for layout fidelity.
          4. After each meaningful update, re-render pages and verify alignment, spacing, and legibility.

          ## Temp and output conventions
          - Use `tmp/pdfs/` for intermediate files; delete when done.
          - Write final artifacts under `output/pdf/` when working in this repo.
          - Keep filenames stable and descriptive.

          ## Dependencies (install if missing)
          Prefer `uv` for dependency management.

          Python packages:
          ```
          uv pip install reportlab pdfplumber pypdf
          ```
          If `uv` is unavailable:
          ```
          python3 -m pip install reportlab pdfplumber pypdf
          ```
          System tools (for rendering):
          ```
          # macOS (Homebrew)
          brew install poppler

          # Ubuntu/Debian
          sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils
          ```

          If installation isn't possible in this environment, tell the user which dependency is missing and how to install it locally.

          ## Environment
          No required environment variables.

          ## Rendering command
          ```
          pdftoppm -png $INPUT_PDF $OUTPUT_PREFIX
          ```

          ## Quality expectations
          - Maintain polished visual design: consistent typography, spacing, margins, and section hierarchy.
          - Avoid rendering issues: clipped text, overlapping elements, broken tables, black squares, or unreadable glyphs.
          - Charts, tables, and images must be sharp, aligned, and clearly labeled.
          - Use ASCII hyphens only. Avoid U+2011 (non-breaking hyphen) and other Unicode dashes.
          - Citations and references must be human-readable; never leave tool tokens or placeholder strings.

          ## Final checks
          - Do not deliver until the latest PNG inspection shows zero visual or formatting defects.
          - Confirm headers/footers, page numbering, and section transitions look polished.
          - Keep intermediate files organized or remove them after final approval.
