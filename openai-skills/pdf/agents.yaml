          description: "Use when tasks involve reading, creating, or reviewing PDF files where rendering and layout matter; prefer visual checks by rendering pages (Poppler) and use Python tools such as `reportlab`, `pdfplumber`, and `pypdf` for generation and extraction."

          # PDF Skill
          
          ## When to use
          - Read or review PDF content where layout and visuals matter.
          - Create PDFs programmatically with reliable formatting.
          - Validate final rendering before delivery.
          
          ## Workflow
          1. Prefer visual review: render PDF pages to PNGs and inspect them.
             - Use `pdftoppm` if available.
             - If unavailable, install Poppler or ask the user to review the output locally.
          2. Use `reportlab` to generate PDFs when creating new documents.
          3. Use `pdfplumber` (or `pypdf`) for text extraction and quick checks; do not rely on it for layout fidelity.
          4. After each meaningful update, re-render pages and verify alignment, spacing, and legibility.
          
          ## Temp and output conventions
          - Use `tmp/pdfs/` for intermediate files; delete when done.
          - Write final artifacts under `output/pdf/` when working in this repo.
          - Keep filenames stable and descriptive.
          
          ## Dependencies (install if missing)
          Prefer `uv` for dependency management.
          
          Python packages:
          ```
          uv pip install reportlab pdfplumber pypdf
          ```
          If `uv` is unavailable:
          ```
          python3 -m pip install reportlab pdfplumber pypdf
          ```
          System tools (for rendering):
          ```
          # macOS (Homebrew)
          brew install poppler
          
          # Ubuntu/Debian
          sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils
          ```
          
          If installation isn't possible in this environment, tell the user which dependency is missing and how to install it locally.
          
          ## Environment
          No required environment variables.
          
          ## Rendering command
          ```
          pdftoppm -png $INPUT_PDF $OUTPUT_PREFIX
          ```
          
          ## Quality expectations
          - Maintain polished visual design: consistent typography, spacing, margins, and section hierarchy.
          - Avoid rendering issues: clipped text, overlapping elements, broken tables, black squares, or unreadable glyphs.
          - Charts, tables, and images must be sharp, aligned, and clearly labeled.
          - Use ASCII hyphens only. Avoid U+2011 (non-breaking hyphen) and other Unicode dashes.
          - Citations and references must be human-readable; never leave tool tokens or placeholder strings.
          
          ## Final checks
          - Do not deliver until the latest PNG inspection shows zero visual or formatting defects.
          - Confirm headers/footers, page numbering, and section transitions look polished.
          - Keep intermediate files organized or remove them after final approval.
