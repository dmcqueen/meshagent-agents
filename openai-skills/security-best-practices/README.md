# OpenAI Security Best Practices

## Summary

An agent that uses OpenAI's security-best-practices skill and powered by gpt-5.2

## Description

This agent helps teams and users get clear, actionable guidance on security best practices relevant to their goals and constraints, turning ambiguous or high-level security questions into specific steps, checklists, or prioritized recommendations. It can answer domain-specific security questions, adapt advice to different contexts, and produce outputs that can be used directly in planning, risk assessments, or implementation tasks. The agent is intended to streamline decision-making around security practices and help translate requirements into concrete actions and outcomes. It is designed to work interactively so teams can refine recommendations to fit their constraints and objectives.
