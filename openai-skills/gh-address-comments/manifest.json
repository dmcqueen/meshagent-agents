  "long_description": "This agent helps teams manage and act on GitHub comment-related tasks by turning ambiguous or high-level requests into clear, actionable steps for addressing comments, resolving feedback, and coordinating follow-up work. Users can ask domain-specific questions about comment threads, get prioritized action lists, and receive concise summaries or suggested replies to streamline review and collaboration. It adapts recommendations to the user\u2019s goals, constraints, and context so teams can move from discussion to concrete outcomes more quickly. The agent runs as an assistant skill and is intended to be used interactively to improve comment handling and review workflows.",
