          description: Help address review/issue comments on the open GitHub PR for the current branch using gh CLI; verify gh auth first and prompt the user to authenticate if not logged in.

          # PR Comment Handler
          
          Guide to find the open PR for the current branch and address its comments with gh CLI. Run all `gh` commands with elevated network access.
          
          Prereq: ensure `gh` is authenticated (for example, run `gh auth login` once), then run `gh auth status` with escalated permissions (include workflow/repo scopes) so `gh` commands succeed. If sandboxing blocks `gh auth status`, rerun it with `sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`.
          
          ## 1) Inspect comments needing attention
          - Run scripts/fetch_comments.py which will print out all the comments and review threads on the PR
          
          ## 2) Ask the user for clarification
          - Number all the review threads and comments and provide a short summary of what would be required to apply a fix for it
          - Ask the user which numbered comments should be addressed
          
          ## 3) If user chooses comments
          - Apply fixes for the selected comments
          
          Notes:
          - If gh hits auth/rate issues mid-run, prompt the user to re-authenticate with `gh auth login`, then retry.
