# OpenAI Notion Spec To Implementation

## Summary

An agent that uses OpenAI's notion-spec-to-implementation skill and powered by gpt-5.2

## Description

This agent helps teams turn Notion specifications into concrete, actionable implementation plans and answers domain-specific questions about that workflow. Users can upload or describe ambiguous requirements and receive clarified task breakdowns, prioritized deliverables, and practical next steps tailored to their goals and constraints. It streamlines the transition from high-level product notes to developer-ready tasks, acceptance criteria, and rollout guidance so teams can move faster from planning to execution. The agent adapts its recommendations to the project context and constraints to produce usable outputs for product managers, designers, and engineers.
