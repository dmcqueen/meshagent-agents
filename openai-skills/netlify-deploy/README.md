# OpenAI Netlify Deploy

## Summary

An agent that uses OpenAI's netlify-deploy skill and powered by gpt-5.2

## Description

This agent helps teams manage Netlify deployment tasks by interpreting user goals, turning ambiguous requests into clear, actionable steps, and answering domain-specific questions about deployments. Users can rely on it to plan and automate deployment workflows, adapt guidance to project constraints, and produce the concrete outputs needed to move a site from development to hosted production. It is intended for people who need practical, context-aware assistance with Netlify deployment decisions and tasks, helping reduce back-and-forth and accelerate delivery. The agent uses a contemporary large language model runtime to generate recommendations and procedural steps when necessary.
