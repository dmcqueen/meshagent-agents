# OpenAI Yeet

## Summary

## Description

This agent helps users and teams get clear, actionable guidance and answers for tasks related to yeet work, turning ambiguous requests into concrete steps, recommendations, or domain-specific explanations. It is suited for clarifying goals, adapting advice to constraints and context, and producing outputs that help move projects forward—such as plans, checklists, or decision-making support.
