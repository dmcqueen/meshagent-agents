# OpenAI Yeet

## Summary

An agent that uses OpenAI's yeet skill and powered by gpt-5.2

## Description

This agent helps users and teams get clear, actionable guidance and answers for tasks related to yeet work, turning ambiguous requests into concrete steps, recommendations, or domain-specific explanations. It is suited for clarifying goals, adapting advice to constraints and context, and producing outputs that help move projects forward—such as plans, checklists, or decision-making support. Teams can use it to resolve questions, align on next actions, and generate task-focused content that advances their objectives.
