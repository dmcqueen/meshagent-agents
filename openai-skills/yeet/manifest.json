  "long_description": "This plugin supports yeet workflows and is designed to help users complete practical work with less manual effort. It can answer domain-specific questions in yeet work, turn ambiguous requests into actionable outputs, and adapt guidance to user goals, constraints, and context. Built-in guidance and reusable skills help keep outputs consistent, context-aware, and action-oriented. It works well for both quick answers and multi-step tasks that require planning, drafting, and refinement. Teams can use it as a day-to-day assistant for yeet decisions, analysis, and communication.",
