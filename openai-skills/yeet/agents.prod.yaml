             the copyright owner that is granting the License.

             "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
             other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
             control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
             "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
             direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
             otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
             outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

             "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
             exercising permissions granted by this License.

             "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

             "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
             transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
             not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
             and conversions to other media types.

             "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
             Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
             copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
             (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

             "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
             form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
             editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
             represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
             of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
             separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
             the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

             "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
             the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
             to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
             submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
             or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
             the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

             communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
             and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
             Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
             excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
             designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

             "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
             on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
             subsequently incorporated within the Work.

          2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
             publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
             Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                 the Derivative Works; and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
             the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
             and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
             or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
             License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
             on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
             any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

          APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

             To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
             boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
             replaced with your own identifying information. (Don\'t include
             the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
             comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
             file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
             same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
             identification within third-party archives.

          name: "yeet"
          description: "Use only when the user explicitly asks to stage, commit, push, and open a GitHub pull request in one flow using the GitHub CLI (`gh`)."
          ---

          ## Prerequisites

          - Require GitHub CLI `gh`. Check `gh --version`. If missing, ask the user to install `gh` and stop.
          - Require authenticated `gh` session. Run `gh auth status`. If not authenticated, ask the user to run `gh auth login` (and re-run `gh auth status`) before continuing.

          ## Naming conventions

          - Branch: `codex/{description}` when starting from main/master/default.
          - Commit: `{description}` (terse).
          - PR title: `[codex] {description}` summarizing the full diff.

          ## Workflow

          - If on main/master/default, create a branch: `git checkout -b "codex/{description}"`
          - Otherwise stay on the current branch.
          - Confirm status, then stage everything: `git status -sb` then `git add -A`.
          - Commit tersely with the description: `git commit -m "{description}"`
          - Run checks if not already. If checks fail due to missing deps/tools, install dependencies and rerun once.
          - Push with tracking: `git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)`
          - If git push fails due to workflow auth errors, pull from master and retry the push.
          - Open a PR and edit title/body to reflect the description and the deltas: `GH_PROMPT_DISABLED=1 GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 gh pr create --draft --fill --head $(git branch --show-current)`
          - Write the PR description to a temp file with real newlines (e.g. pr-body.md ... EOF) and run pr-body.md to avoid \\n-escaped markdown.
          - PR description (markdown) must be detailed prose covering the issue, the cause and effect on users, the root cause, the fix, and any tests or checks used to validate.
