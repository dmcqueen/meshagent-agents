# OpenAI OpenAI Docs

## Summary

An agent that uses OpenAI's openai-docs skill and powered by gpt-5.2

## Description

This plugin supports openai-docs workflows and is designed to help users complete practical work with less manual effort. It can answer domain-specific questions in openai-docs work, turn ambiguous requests into actionable outputs, and adapt guidance to user goals, constraints, and context. Built-in guidance and reusable skills help keep outputs consistent, context-aware, and action-oriented. It works well for both quick answers and multi-step tasks that require planning, drafting, and refinement. Teams can use it as a day-to-day assistant for openai-docs decisions, analysis, and communication.
