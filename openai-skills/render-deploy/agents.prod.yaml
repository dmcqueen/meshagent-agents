             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

             License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
             on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
             any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          description: Deploy applications to Render by analyzing codebases, generating render.yaml Blueprints, and providing Dashboard deeplinks. Use when the user wants to deploy, host, publish, or set up their application on Render's cloud platform.
          ---

          # Deploy to Render

          Render supports **Git-backed** services and **prebuilt Docker image** services.

          This skill covers **Git-backed** flows:
          1. **Blueprint Method** - Generate render.yaml for Infrastructure-as-Code deployments
          2. **Direct Creation** - Create services instantly via MCP tools

          Blueprints can also run a **prebuilt Docker image** by using `runtime: image`, but the `render.yaml` still must live in a Git repo.

          If there is no Git remote, stop and ask the user to either:
          - Create/push a Git remote (can be minimal if only the Blueprint is needed), or
          - Use the Render Dashboard/API to deploy a prebuilt Docker image (MCP cannot create image-backed services).

          ## Prerequisites

          - When sandboxing blocks the deployment network calls, rerun with `sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`.
          - The deployment might take a few minutes. Use appropriate timeout values.

          ## When to Use This Skill

          Activate this skill when users want to:
          - Deploy an application to Render
          - Create a render.yaml Blueprint file
          - Set up Render deployment for their project
          - Host or publish their application on Render's cloud platform
          - Create databases, cron jobs, or other Render resources

          ## Happy Path (New Users)

          Use this short prompt sequence before deep analysis to reduce friction:
          1. Ask whether they want to deploy from a Git repo or a prebuilt Docker image.
          2. Ask whether Render should provision everything the app needs (based on what seems likely from the user's description) or only the app while they bring their own infra. If dependencies are unclear, ask a short follow-up to confirm whether they need a database, workers, cron, or other services.

          Then proceed with the appropriate method below.

          ## Choose Your Source Path

          **Git Repo Path:** Required for both Blueprint and Direct Creation. The repo must be pushed to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

          **Prebuilt Docker Image Path:** Supported by Render via image-backed services. This is **not** supported by MCP; use the Dashboard/API. Ask for:
          - Image URL (registry + tag)
          - Registry auth (if private)
          - Service type (web/worker) and port

          If the user chooses a Docker image, guide them to the Render Dashboard image deploy flow or ask them to add a Git remote (so you can use a Blueprint with `runtime: image`).

          ## Choose Your Deployment Method (Git Repo)

          Both methods require a Git repository pushed to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. (If using `runtime: image`, the repo can be minimal and only contain `render.yaml`.)

          | Method | Best For | Pros |
          |--------|----------|------|
          | **Blueprint** | Multi-service apps, IaC workflows | Version controlled, reproducible, supports complex setups |
          | **Direct Creation** | Single services, quick deployments | Instant creation, no render.yaml file needed |

          ### Method Selection Heuristic

          Use this decision rule by default unless the user requests a specific method. Analyze the codebase first; only ask if deployment intent is unclear (e.g., DB, workers, cron).

          **Use Direct Creation (MCP) when ALL are true:**
          - Single service (one web app or one static site)
          - No separate worker/cron services
          - No attached databases or Key Value
          - Simple env vars only (no shared env groups)
          If this path fits and MCP isn't configured yet, stop and guide MCP setup before proceeding.

          **Use Blueprint when ANY are true:**
          - Multiple services (web + worker, API + frontend, etc.)
          - Databases, Redis/Key Value, or other datastores are required
          - Cron jobs, background workers, or private services
          - You want reproducible IaC or a render.yaml committed to the repo
          - Monorepo or multi-env setup that needs consistent configuration

          If unsure, ask a quick clarifying question, but default to Blueprint for safety. For a single service, strongly prefer Direct Creation via MCP and guide MCP setup if needed.

          ## Prerequisites Check

          When starting a deployment, verify these requirements in order:

          **1. Confirm Source Path (Git vs Docker)**

          If using Git-based methods (Blueprint or Direct Creation), the repo must be pushed to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket. Blueprints that reference a prebuilt image still require a Git repo with `render.yaml`.

          ```bash
          git remote -v
          ```

          - If no remote exists, stop and ask the user to create/push a remote **or** switch to Docker image deploy.

          **2. Check MCP Tools Availability (Preferred for Single-Service)**

          MCP tools provide the best experience. Check if available by attempting:
          ```
          list_services()
          ```

          If MCP tools are available, you can skip CLI installation for most operations.

          **3. Check Render CLI Installation (for Blueprint validation)**
          ```bash
          render --version
          ```
          If not installed, offer to install:
          - macOS: `brew install render`
          - Linux/macOS: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/render-oss/cli/main/bin/install.sh | sh`

          **4. MCP Setup (if MCP isn't configured)**

          If `list_services()` fails because MCP isn't configured, ask whether they want to set up MCP (preferred) or continue with the CLI fallback. If they choose MCP, ask which AI tool they're using, then provide the matching instructions below. Always use their API key.

          ### Cursor

          Walk the user through these steps:

          1) Get a Render API key:
          ```
          https://dashboard.render.com/u/*/settings#api-keys
          ```

          2) Add this to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>`):
          ```json
          {
            "mcpServers": {
              "render": {
                "url": "https://mcp.render.com/mcp",
                "headers": {
                  "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
                }
              }
            }
          }
          ```

          3) Restart Cursor, then retry `list_services()`.

          ### Claude Code

          Walk the user through these steps:

          1) Get a Render API key:
          ```
          https://dashboard.render.com/u/*/settings#api-keys
          ```

          2) Add the MCP server with Claude Code (replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>`):
          ```bash
          claude mcp add --transport http render https://mcp.render.com/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
          ```

          3) Restart Claude Code, then retry `list_services()`.

          ### Codex

          Walk the user through these steps:

          1) Get a Render API key:
          ```
          https://dashboard.render.com/u/*/settings#api-keys
          ```

          2) Set it in their shell:
          ```bash
          export RENDER_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
          ```

          3) Add the MCP server with the Codex CLI:
          ```bash
          codex mcp add render --url https://mcp.render.com/mcp --bearer-token-env-var RENDER_API_KEY
          ```

          4) Restart Codex, then retry `list_services()`.

          ### Other Tools

          If the user is on another AI app, direct them to the Render MCP docs for that tool's setup steps and install method.

          ### Workspace Selection

          After MCP is configured, have the user set the active Render workspace with a prompt like:

          ```
          Set my Render workspace to [WORKSPACE_NAME]
          ```

          **5. Check Authentication (CLI fallback only)**

          If MCP isn't available, use the CLI instead and verify you can access your account:
          ```bash
          # Check if user is logged in (use -o json for non-interactive mode)
          render whoami -o json
          ```

          If `render whoami` fails or returns empty data, the CLI is not authenticated. The CLI won't always prompt automatically, so explicitly prompt the user to authenticate:

          If neither is configured, ask user which method they prefer:
          - **API Key (CLI)**: `export RENDER_API_KEY="rnd_xxxxx"` (Get from https://dashboard.render.com/u/*/settings#api-keys)
          - **Login**: `render login` (Opens browser for OAuth)

          **6. Check Workspace Context**

          Verify the active workspace:
          ```
          get_selected_workspace()
          ```

          Or via CLI:
          ```bash
          render workspace current -o json
          ```

          To list available workspaces:
          ```
          list_workspaces()
          ```

          If user needs to switch workspaces, they must do so via Dashboard or CLI (`render workspace set`).

          Once prerequisites are met, proceed with deployment workflow.

          # Method 1: Blueprint Deployment (Recommended for Complex Apps)

          ## Blueprint Workflow

          ### Step 1: Analyze Codebase

          Analyze the codebase to determine framework/runtime, build and start commands, required env vars, datastores, and port binding. Use the detailed checklists in [references/codebase-analysis.md](references/codebase-analysis.md).

          ### Step 2: Generate render.yaml

          Create a `render.yaml` Blueprint file following the Blueprint specification.

          Complete specification: [references/blueprint-spec.md](references/blueprint-spec.md)

          **Key Points:**
          - Always use `plan: free` unless user specifies otherwise
          - Include ALL environment variables the app needs
          - Mark secrets with `sync: false` (user fills these in Dashboard)
          - Use appropriate service type: `web`, `worker`, `cron`, `static`, or `pserv`
          - Use appropriate runtime: [references/runtimes.md](references/runtimes.md)

          **Basic Structure:**
          ```yaml
          services:
            - type: web
              name: my-app
              runtime: node
              plan: free
              buildCommand: npm ci
              startCommand: npm start
              envVars:
                - key: DATABASE_URL
                  fromDatabase:
                    name: postgres
                    property: connectionString
                - key: JWT_SECRET
                  sync: false  # User fills in Dashboard

          databases:
            - name: postgres
              databaseName: myapp_db
              plan: free
          ```

          **Service Types:**
          - `web`: HTTP services, APIs, web applications (publicly accessible)
          - `worker`: Background job processors (not publicly accessible)
          - `cron`: Scheduled tasks that run on a cron schedule
          - `static`: Static sites (HTML/CSS/JS served via CDN)
          - `pserv`: Private services (internal only, within same account)

          Service type details: [references/service-types.md](references/service-types.md)
          Runtime options: [references/runtimes.md](references/runtimes.md)
          Template examples: [assets/](assets/)

          ### Step 2.5: Immediate Next Steps (Always Provide)

          After creating `render.yaml`, always give the user a short, explicit checklist and run validation immediately when the CLI is available:
          1. **Authenticate (CLI)**: run `render whoami -o json` (if not logged in, run `render login` or set `RENDER_API_KEY`)
          2. **Validate (recommended)**: run `render blueprints validate`
             - If the CLI isn't installed, offer to install it and provide the command.
          3. **Commit + push**: `git add render.yaml && git commit -m "Add Render deployment configuration" && git push origin main`
          4. **Open Dashboard**: Use the Blueprint deeplink and complete Git OAuth if prompted
          5. **Fill secrets**: Set env vars marked `sync: false`
          6. **Deploy**: Click "Apply" and monitor the deploy

          ### Step 3: Validate Configuration

          Validate the render.yaml file to catch errors before deployment. If the CLI is installed, run the commands directly; only prompt the user if the CLI is missing:

          ```bash
          render whoami -o json  # Ensure CLI is authenticated (won't always prompt)
          render blueprints validate
          ```

          Fix any validation errors before proceeding. Common issues:
          - Missing required fields (`name`, `type`, `runtime`)
          - Invalid runtime values
          - Incorrect YAML syntax
          - Invalid environment variable references

          Configuration guide: [references/configuration-guide.md](references/configuration-guide.md)

          ### Step 4: Commit and Push

          **IMPORTANT:** You must merge the `render.yaml` file into your repository before deploying.

          Ensure the `render.yaml` file is committed and pushed to your Git remote:

          ```bash
          git add render.yaml
          git commit -m "Add Render deployment configuration"
          git push origin main
          ```

          If there is no Git remote yet, stop here and guide the user to create a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repo, add it as `origin`, and push before continuing.

          **Why this matters:** The Dashboard deeplink will read the render.yaml from your repository. If the file isn't merged and pushed, Render won't find the configuration and deployment will fail.

          Verify the file is in your remote repository before proceeding to the next step.

          ### Step 5: Generate Deeplink

          Get the Git repository URL:

          ```bash
          git remote get-url origin
          ```

          This will return a URL from your Git provider. **If the URL is SSH format, convert it to HTTPS:**

          | SSH Format | HTTPS Format |
          |------------|--------------|
          | `git@github.com:user/repo.git` | `https://github.com/user/repo` |
          | `git@gitlab.com:user/repo.git` | `https://gitlab.com/user/repo` |
          | `git@bitbucket.org:user/repo.git` | `https://bitbucket.org/user/repo` |

          **Conversion pattern:** Replace `git@<host>:` with `https://<host>/` and remove `.git` suffix.

          Format the Dashboard deeplink using the HTTPS repository URL:
          ```
          https://dashboard.render.com/blueprint/new?repo=<REPOSITORY_URL>
          ```

          Example:
          ```
          https://dashboard.render.com/blueprint/new?repo=https://github.com/username/repo-name
          ```

          ### Step 6: Guide User

          **CRITICAL:** Ensure the user has merged and pushed the render.yaml file to their repository before clicking the deeplink. If the file isn't in the repository, Render cannot read the Blueprint configuration and deployment will fail.

          Provide the deeplink to the user with these instructions:

          1. **Verify render.yaml is merged** - Confirm the file exists in your repository on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
          2. Click the deeplink to open Render Dashboard
          3. Complete Git provider OAuth if prompted
          4. Name the Blueprint (or use default from render.yaml)
          5. Fill in secret environment variables (marked with `sync: false`)
          6. Review services and databases configuration
          7. Click "Apply" to deploy

          The deployment will begin automatically. Users can monitor progress in the Render Dashboard.

          ### Step 7: Verify Deployment

          After the user deploys via Dashboard, verify everything is working.

          **Check deployment status via MCP:**
          ```
          list_deploys(serviceId: "<service-id>", limit: 1)
          ```
          Look for `status: "live"` to confirm successful deployment.

          **Check for runtime errors (wait 2-3 minutes after deploy):**
          ```
          list_logs(resource: ["<service-id>"], level: ["error"], limit: 20)
          ```

          **Check service health metrics:**
          ```
          get_metrics(
            resourceId: "<service-id>",
            metricTypes: ["http_request_count", "cpu_usage", "memory_usage"]
          )
          ```

          If errors are found, proceed to the **Post-deploy verification and basic triage** section below.

          ---

          # Method 2: Direct Service Creation (Quick Single-Service Deployments)

          For simple deployments without Infrastructure-as-Code, create services directly via MCP tools.

          ## When to Use Direct Creation

          - Single web service or static site
          - Quick prototypes or demos
          - When you don't need a render.yaml file in your repo
          - Adding databases or cron jobs to existing projects

          ## Prerequisites for Direct Creation

          **Repository must be pushed to a Git provider.** Render clones your repository to build and deploy services.

          ```bash
          git remote -v  # Verify remote exists
          git push origin main  # Ensure code is pushed
          ```

          Supported providers: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

          If no remote exists, stop and ask the user to create/push a remote or switch to Docker image deploy.

          **Note:** MCP does not support creating image-backed services. Use the Dashboard/API for prebuilt Docker image deploys.

          ## Direct Creation Workflow

          Use the concise steps below, and refer to [references/direct-creation.md](references/direct-creation.md) for full MCP command examples and follow-on configuration.

          ### Step 1: Analyze Codebase
          Use [references/codebase-analysis.md](references/codebase-analysis.md) to determine runtime, build/start commands, env vars, and datastores.

          ### Step 2: Create Resources via MCP
          Create the service (web or static) and any required databases or key-value stores. See [references/direct-creation.md](references/direct-creation.md).

          If MCP returns an error about missing Git credentials or repo access, stop and guide the user to connect their Git provider in the Render Dashboard, then retry.

          ### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
          Add required env vars via MCP after creation. See [references/direct-creation.md](references/direct-creation.md).

          Remind the user that secrets can be set in the Dashboard if they prefer not to pass them via MCP.

          ### Step 4: Verify Deployment
          Check deploy status, logs, and metrics. See [references/direct-creation.md](references/direct-creation.md).

          ---

          For service discovery, configuration details, quick commands, and common issues, see [references/deployment-details.md](references/deployment-details.md).

          ---

          # Post-deploy verification and basic triage (All Methods)

          Keep this short and repeatable. If any check fails, fix it before redeploying.

          1. Confirm the latest deploy is `live` and serving traffic
          2. Hit the health endpoint (or root) and verify a 200 response
          3. Scan recent error logs for a clear failure signature
          4. Verify required env vars and port binding (`0.0.0.0:$PORT`)

          Detailed checklist and commands: [references/post-deploy-checks.md](references/post-deploy-checks.md)

          If the service fails to start or health checks time out, use the basic triage guide:
          [references/troubleshooting-basics.md](references/troubleshooting-basics.md)

          ## Troubleshooting

          ### Escalated Network Access

          If deployment fails due to network issues (timeouts, DNS errors, connection resets), rerun the deploy with escalated permissions (use `sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`). The deploy requires escalated network access when sandbox networking blocks outbound requests.

          Example guidance to the user:

          ```
          The deploy needs escalated network access to deploy to Render. I can rerun the command with escalated permissions—want me to proceed?
          ```

          Optional: If you need deeper diagnostics (metrics/DB checks/error catalog), suggest installing the
          `render-debug` skill. It is not required for the core deploy flow.

          # Render Blueprint Specification

          Complete reference for render.yaml Blueprint files. Blueprints define your infrastructure as code for reproducible deployments on Render.

          ## Overview

          A Blueprint is a YAML file (typically `render.yaml`) placed in your repository root that describes:
          - Services (web, worker, cron, static, private)
          - Databases (PostgreSQL, Redis)
          - Environment variables and secrets
          - Scaling and resource configuration
          - Project organization

          ## Root-Level Structure

          ```yaml
          # Top-level fields
          services: []         # Array of service definitions
          databases: []        # Array of PostgreSQL databases
          envVarGroups: []     # Reusable environment variable groups (optional)
          projects: []         # Project organization (optional)
          ungrouped: []        # Resources outside projects (optional)
          previews:            # Preview environment configuration (optional)
            generation: auto_preview | manual | none
          ```

          ## Service Types

          ### Web Services (`type: web`)

          HTTP services, APIs, and web applications. Publicly accessible via HTTPS.

          **Required fields:**
          - `name`: Unique service identifier
          - `type`: Must be `web`
          - `runtime`: Language/environment (see Runtimes section)
          - `buildCommand`: Command to build the application
          - `startCommand`: Command to start the server

          **Common optional fields:**
          - `plan`: Instance type (default: `free`)
          - `region`: Deployment region (default: `oregon`)
          - `branch`: Git branch to deploy (default: `main`)
          - `autoDeploy`: Auto-deploy on push (default: `true`)
          - `envVars`: Environment variables array
          - `healthCheckPath`: Health check endpoint (default: `/`)
          - `numInstances`: Number of instances (manual scaling)
          - `scaling`: Autoscaling configuration

          **Example:**
          ```yaml
          services:
            - type: web
              name: api-server
              runtime: node
              plan: free
              buildCommand: npm ci
              startCommand: npm start
              branch: main
              autoDeploy: true
              envVars:
                - key: NODE_ENV
                  value: production
                - key: PORT
                  value: 10000
          ```

          ### Worker Services (`type: worker`)

          Background job processors, queue consumers. Not publicly accessible.

          **Required fields:**
          - `name`: Unique service identifier
          - `type`: Must be `worker`
          - `runtime`: Language/environment
          - `buildCommand`: Command to build
          - `startCommand`: Command to start worker process

          **Key differences from web services:**
          - No public URL
          - No health checks
          - No port binding required

          **Example:**
          ```yaml
          services:
            - type: worker
              name: job-processor
              runtime: python
              plan: free
              buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
              startCommand: celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info
              envVars:
                - key: REDIS_URL
                  fromDatabase:
                    name: redis
                    property: connectionString
          ```

          ### Cron Jobs (`type: cron`)

          - `name`: Unique service identifier
          - `type`: Must be `cron`
          - `runtime`: Language/environment
          - `schedule`: Cron expression
          - `buildCommand`: Command to build
          - `startCommand`: Command to execute on schedule

          **Schedule format:** Standard cron syntax (minute hour day month weekday)

          **Examples:**
          - `0 0 * * *` - Daily at midnight UTC
          - `*/15 * * * *` - Every 15 minutes
          - `0 9 * * 1` - Every Monday at 9 AM UTC

          **Example:**
          ```yaml
          services:
            - type: cron
              name: daily-backup
              runtime: node
              schedule: "0 2 * * *"
              buildCommand: npm ci
              startCommand: node scripts/backup.js
              envVars:
                - key: DATABASE_URL
                  fromDatabase:
                    name: postgres
                    property: connectionString
          ```

          ### Static Sites (`type: static` or `type: web` with `runtime: static`)

          **Always default to `plan: free` unless user specifies otherwise.**

          ## Regions

          Available deployment regions:

          - `oregon` (US West) - Default
          - `ohio` (US East)
          - `virginia` (US East)

            - type: web
              name: my-app
              runtime: node
              region: frankfurt
          ```

          ## Environment Variables

          Three patterns for defining environment variables:

          ### 1. Hardcoded Values

          For non-sensitive configuration:

          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: NODE_ENV
              value: production
            - key: API_URL
              value: https://api.example.com
            - key: LOG_LEVEL
              value: info
          ```

          ### 2. Generated Secrets

          Render generates a base64-encoded 256-bit random value:

          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: SESSION_SECRET
              generateValue: true
            - key: ENCRYPTION_KEY
              generateValue: true
          ```

          ### 3. User-Provided Secrets

          Prompt user for values during Blueprint creation:

          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
              sync: false
            - key: JWT_SECRET
              sync: false
            - key: API_KEY
              sync: false
          ```

          **The `sync: false` flag means "user will fill this in the Dashboard".**

          ### 4. Database References

          Link to database connection strings:

          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: DATABASE_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: postgres
                property: connectionString
            - key: REDIS_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: redis
                property: connectionString
          ```

          **Available properties:**
          - `connectionString`: Full connection URL
          - `host`: Database host
          - `port`: Database port
          - `user`: Database username
          - `password`: Database password
          - `database`: Database name
          - `hostport`: Combined `host:port`

          ### 5. Service References

          Link to other services:

          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: API_URL
              fromService:
                name: api-server
                type: web
                property: host
          ```

          ### 6. Environment Variable Groups

          Reusable groups shared across services:

          ```yaml
          envVarGroups:
            - name: shared-config
              envVars:
                - key: LOG_LEVEL
                  value: info
                - key: ENVIRONMENT
                  value: production

          services:
            - type: web
              name: web-app
              runtime: node
              envVars:
                - fromGroup: shared-config
                - key: PORT
                  value: 10000
          ```

          ## Databases

          ### PostgreSQL

          ```yaml
          databases:
            - name: postgres
              databaseName: myapp_prod
              user: myapp_user
              plan: free
              postgresMajorVersion: "15"
              ipAllowList: []
          ```

          **Plans:**
          - `free`: 1 GB storage, 97 MB RAM, 0.1 CPU
          - `basic-256mb`, `basic-512mb`, `basic-1gb`, `basic-4gb`
          - `pro-4gb`, `pro-8gb`, `pro-16gb`, etc.
          - `accelerated-4gb`, `accelerated-8gb`, etc. (SSD-backed)

          **Key fields:**
          - `name`: Identifier for references
          - `databaseName`: Actual PostgreSQL database name
          - `user`: Database username
          - `postgresMajorVersion`: PostgreSQL version (11-16)
          - `ipAllowList`: Array of CIDR blocks (empty = internal only)
          - `diskSizeGB`: Storage size (paid plans only)

          **High Availability (paid plans):**
          ```yaml
          databases:
            - name: postgres
              databaseName: myapp_prod
              plan: pro-4gb
              highAvailabilityEnabled: true
          ```

          **Read Replicas (paid plans):**
          ```yaml
          databases:
            - name: postgres
              databaseName: myapp_prod
              plan: pro-4gb
              readReplicas:
                - name: read-replica-1
                  region: ohio
                - name: read-replica-2
                  region: frankfurt
          ```

          ### Redis (Key-Value Store)

          ```yaml
          databases:
            - name: redis
              plan: free
              maxmemoryPolicy: allkeys-lru
              ipAllowList: []
          ```

          **Plans:** Same as PostgreSQL

          **maxmemoryPolicy options:**
          - `allkeys-lru`: Evict least recently used keys
          - `volatile-lru`: Evict LRU keys with TTL
          - `allkeys-random`: Evict random keys
          - `volatile-random`: Evict random keys with TTL
          - `volatile-ttl`: Evict keys with soonest TTL
          - `noeviction`: Return errors when memory full

          ## Scaling

          ### Manual Scaling

          Fixed number of instances:

          ```yaml
          services:
            - type: web
              name: my-app
              runtime: node
              plan: standard
              numInstances: 3
          ```

          ### Autoscaling

          Dynamic scaling based on CPU/memory (Professional workspace required):

          ```yaml
          services:
            - type: web
              name: my-app
              runtime: node
              plan: standard
              scaling:
                minInstances: 1
                maxInstances: 5
                targetCPUPercent: 60
                targetMemoryPercent: 70
          ```

          **Notes:**
          - Autoscaling disabled in preview environments
          - Preview environments run `minInstances` count
          - Requires Professional or higher workspace

          ## Health Checks

          Configure health check endpoints:

          ```yaml
          services:
            - type: web
              name: my-app
              runtime: node
              healthCheckPath: /health
          ```

          **Default:** `/` (root path)

          **Recommended:** Add a dedicated `/health` endpoint that returns `200 OK`.

          ## Build Filters

          Control when builds are triggered based on changed files:

          ```yaml
          services:
            - type: web
              name: frontend
              runtime: static
              buildFilter:
                paths:
                  - frontend/**
                ignoredPaths:
                  - frontend/README.md
                  - frontend/**/*.test.js
          ```

          **Behavior:**
          - If `paths` specified: Build only when files in those paths change
          - If `ignoredPaths` specified: Don't build when only ignored files change

          ## Projects and Environments

          Organize services into projects with multiple environments:

          ```yaml
          projects:
            - name: my-application
              environments:
                - name: production
                  services:
                    - type: web
                      name: prod-api
                      runtime: node
                      plan: pro
                      buildCommand: npm ci
                      startCommand: npm start
                  databases:
                    - name: prod-postgres
                      plan: pro-4gb
                  networking:
                    isolation: enabled
                  permissions:
                    protection: enabled

                - name: staging
                  services:
                    - type: web
                      name: staging-api
                      runtime: node
                      plan: starter
                      buildCommand: npm ci
                      startCommand: npm start
                  databases:
                    - name: staging-postgres
                      plan: free
          ```

          **Environment features:**
          - `networking.isolation`: Enable network isolation between environments
          - `permissions.protection`: Require approval for environment changes

          ## Preview Environments

          Configure automatic preview environments for pull requests:

          ```yaml
          previews:
            generation: auto_preview  # auto_preview | manual | none
          ```

          **Options:**
          - `auto_preview`: Create preview environment for each PR automatically
          - `manual`: User manually triggers preview creation
          - `none`: Disable preview environments

          ## Complete Example

          Full-featured Blueprint with multiple services and databases:

          ```yaml
          services:
            # Web service
            - type: web
              name: web-app
              runtime: node
              plan: free
              region: oregon
              buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
              startCommand: npm start
              branch: main
              autoDeploy: true
              healthCheckPath: /health
              envVars:
                - key: NODE_ENV
                  value: production
                - key: DATABASE_URL
                  fromDatabase:
                    name: postgres
                    property: connectionString
                - key: REDIS_URL
                  fromDatabase:
                    name: redis
                    property: connectionString
                - key: JWT_SECRET
                  sync: false

            # Background worker
            - type: worker
              name: queue-worker
              runtime: node
              plan: free
              buildCommand: npm ci
              startCommand: node worker.js
              envVars:
                - key: REDIS_URL
                  fromDatabase:
                    name: redis
                    property: connectionString

            # Cron job
            - type: cron
              name: daily-cleanup
              runtime: node
              schedule: "0 3 * * *"
              buildCommand: npm ci
              startCommand: node scripts/cleanup.js
              envVars:
                - key: DATABASE_URL
                  fromDatabase:
                    name: postgres
                    property: connectionString

            # Static frontend
            - type: web
              name: frontend
              runtime: static
              buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
              staticPublishPath: ./dist
              routes:
                - type: rewrite
                  source: /*
                  destination: /index.html

          databases:
            - name: postgres
              databaseName: app_production
              user: app_user
              plan: free
              postgresMajorVersion: "15"
              ipAllowList: []

            - name: redis
              plan: free
              maxmemoryPolicy: allkeys-lru
              ipAllowList: []
          ```

          ## Validation

          Validate your Blueprint before deploying (when CLI command is available):

          ```bash
          render blueprint validate
          ```

          **Common validation errors:**
          - Missing required fields
          - Invalid runtime values
          - Incorrect environment variable references
          - Invalid cron expressions
          - Invalid YAML syntax

          ## Best Practices

          1. **Always use `plan: free` by default** - Let users upgrade if needed
          2. **Mark all secrets with `sync: false`** - Never hardcode sensitive values
          3. **Use `fromDatabase` for database URLs** - Automatic internal connection strings
          4. **Add health check endpoints** - Faster deployment detection
          5. **Use non-interactive build commands** - Prevents build hangs
          6. **Bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`** - Required for web services
          7. **Use environment variable groups** - Share config across services
          8. **Enable autoDeploy: true** - Deploy automatically on push
          9. **Set appropriate regions** - Choose closest to your users
          10. **Use build filters** - Optimize build triggers in monorepos

          # Codebase Analysis (Deploy)

          Use this reference for framework-specific detection and build/start command selection when preparing a Render deployment.

          ## Node.js Projects
          - Read `package.json` to detect framework (Express, Next.js, Nest.js, Fastify, etc.)
          - Check `scripts` section for build/start commands
          - Look for `engines` field for Node version, or look in `.node-versions` or `.nvmrc`
          - Detect package manager:
            - `bun.lockb` (Bun) -> `bun install --frozen-lockfile` / `bun run start`
            - `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm) -> `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` / `pnpm start`
            - `yarn.lock` (Yarn) -> `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` / `yarn start`
            - `package-lock.json` (npm) -> `npm ci` / `npm start`
            - `package.json` only (npm fallback) -> `npm install` / `npm start`

          ## Python Projects
          - Check for dependency files and detect package manager:
            - `uv.lock` (uv) -> `uv sync` / `uv run gunicorn app:app`
            - `poetry.lock` (Poetry) -> `poetry install --no-dev` / `poetry run gunicorn app:app`
            - `Pipfile.lock` (pipenv) -> `pipenv install --deploy` / `pipenv run gunicorn app:app`
            - `requirements.txt` (pip) -> `pip install -r requirements.txt` / `gunicorn app:app`
            - `pyproject.toml` only -> check for `[tool.uv]`, `[tool.poetry]`, or use pip
          - Detect framework: Django, Flask, FastAPI, Celery, others
          - Check for Python version:
            - `.python-version` (uv/pyenv)
            - `runtime.txt` (Render-specific)
            - `pyproject.toml` (requires-python field)

          ## Go Projects
          - Read `go.mod` for dependencies
          - Identify web framework (Gin, Echo, Chi, Fiber, net/http)
          - Note Go version from `go.mod`

          ## Static Sites
          - Look for build output directories (`build/`, `dist/`, `site/`, `public/`)
          - Detect framework: React, Vue, Gatsby, Next.js (static export)
          - Check build scripts in `package.json`

          ## Docker Projects
          - Look for `Dockerfile`
          - Note exposed ports and build stages
          - Check for `docker-compose.yml` patterns

          ## Key Information to Extract
          - Build command (e.g., `npm ci`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `go build`)
          - Start command (e.g., `npm start`, `gunicorn app:app`, `./bin/app`)
          - Environment variables used in code (API keys, database URLs, secrets)
          - Database requirements (PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB)
          - Port binding (check if app uses an environment variable for port to run on)

          # Render Configuration Guide

          Common configuration patterns, best practices, and troubleshooting for Render deployments.

          ## Environment Variables

          ### Required vs Optional Variables

          **Always declare ALL environment variables in render.yaml**, even if values are provided by user later.

          **Three categories:**

          1. **Configuration values** (hardcoded):
          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: NODE_ENV
              value: production
            - key: LOG_LEVEL
              value: info
            - key: API_URL
              value: https://api.example.com
          ```

          2. **Secrets** (user provides):
          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: JWT_SECRET
              sync: false
            - key: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
              sync: false
            - key: API_KEY
              sync: false
          ```

          3. **Auto-generated** (Render provides):
          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: SESSION_SECRET
              generateValue: true
            - key: ENCRYPTION_KEY
              generateValue: true
          ```

          ### Database Connection Patterns

          **PostgreSQL:**
          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: DATABASE_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: postgres
                property: connectionString
          ```

          **Redis:**
          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: REDIS_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: redis
                property: connectionString
          ```

          **Multiple databases:**
          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: PRIMARY_DB_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: postgres-primary
                property: connectionString
            - key: ANALYTICS_DB_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: postgres-analytics
                property: connectionString
            - key: CACHE_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: redis
                property: connectionString
          ```

          ### Cross-Service References

          Reference other services in your account:

          ```yaml
          services:
            - type: web
              name: frontend
              runtime: node
              envVars:
                - key: API_URL
                  fromService:
                    name: backend-api
                    type: web
                    property: host  # or hostport, port

            - type: web
              name: backend-api
              runtime: node
          ```

          **Available properties:**
          - `host`: Service hostname
          - `port`: Service port
          - `hostport`: Combined `host:port`

          ### Environment Variable Groups

          Share common configuration across services:

          ```yaml
          envVarGroups:
            - name: common-config
              envVars:
                - key: NODE_ENV
                  value: production
                - key: LOG_LEVEL
                  value: info
                - key: TZ
                  value: UTC

          services:
            - type: web
              name: web-app
              runtime: node
              envVars:
                - fromGroup: common-config
                - key: PORT
                  value: 10000

            - type: worker
              name: worker
              runtime: node
              envVars:
                - fromGroup: common-config
          ```

          ---

          ## Port Binding

          ### The Port Binding Requirement

          **CRITICAL:** Web services must bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`

          **Why this matters:**
          - Render sets `PORT` environment variable (default: 10000)
          - Services must bind to `0.0.0.0` (not `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`)
          - Health checks fail if port binding is incorrect
          - Deployment will fail or service won't receive traffic

          ### Code Examples by Language

          **Node.js / Express:**
          ```javascript
          const express = require('express');
          const app = express();

          const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

          app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
            console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
          });
          ```

          **Python / Flask:**
          ```python
          import os
          from flask import Flask

          app = Flask(__name__)

          if __name__ == '__main__':
              port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
              app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
          ```

          **Python / Django:**

          In `settings.py`:
          ```python
          # Django runs on port specified by environment
          ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
          ```

          Start command in render.yaml:
          ```yaml
          startCommand: gunicorn config.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
          ```

          **Python / FastAPI:**
          ```python
          import os
          import uvicorn
          from fastapi import FastAPI

          app = FastAPI()

          if __name__ == "__main__":
              port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8000))
              uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=port)
          ```

          Start command:
          ```yaml
          startCommand: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
          ```

          **Go:**
          ```go
          package main

          import (
              "fmt"
              "net/http"
              "os"
          )

          func main() {
              port := os.Getenv("PORT")
              if port == "" {
                  port = "3000"
              }

              http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
              fmt.Printf("Server starting on port %s\n", port)
              http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, nil)
          }
          ```

          **Ruby / Rails:**

          In `config/puma.rb`:
          ```ruby
          port ENV.fetch("PORT") { 3000 }
          bind "tcp://0.0.0.0:#{ENV.fetch('PORT', 3000)}"
          ```

          **Rust / Actix:**
          ```rust
          use actix_web::{App, HttpServer};
          use std::env;

          #[actix_web::main]
          async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
              let port = env::var("PORT").unwrap_or_else(|_| "8080".to_string());
              let addr = format!("0.0.0.0:{}", port);

              HttpServer::new(|| App::new())
                  .bind(&addr)?
                  .run()
                  .await
          }
          ```

          ---

          ## Build Commands

          ### Non-Interactive Flags

          **Always use non-interactive flags** to prevent builds from hanging waiting for input.

          **npm (Node.js):**
          ```yaml
          buildCommand: npm ci
          # NOT: npm install
          ```

          **pip (Python):**
          ```yaml
          buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
          # Already non-interactive
          ```

          **apt (System packages):**
          ```yaml
          buildCommand: apt-get update && apt-get install -y libpq-dev
          # Use -y flag to auto-confirm
          ```

          **bundler (Ruby):**
          ```yaml
          buildCommand: bundle install --jobs=4 --retry=3
          ```

          ### Build with Additional Steps

          **Node.js with build step:**
          ```yaml
          buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
          ```

          **Python Django with static files:**
          ```yaml
          buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
          ```

          **Ruby Rails with assets:**
          ```yaml
          buildCommand: bundle install && bundle exec rails assets:precompile
          ```

          ### Build Timeouts

          **Free tier:** 15 minutes
          **Paid tiers:** Configurable

          **If builds timeout:**
          1. Optimize dependencies (remove unused packages)
          2. Use build caching
          3. Consider pre-building in CI/CD
          4. Upgrade to paid tier for longer timeouts

          ---

          ## Database Connections

          ### Internal vs External URLs

          **Use internal URLs for better performance:**

          When using `fromDatabase`, Render automatically provides internal `.render-internal.com` URLs:

          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: DATABASE_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: postgres
                property: connectionString
          ```

          This provides: `postgresql://user:pass@postgres.render-internal.com:5432/db`

          **Benefits:**
          - Lower latency (same data center)
          - No external bandwidth charges
          - Automatic internal DNS

          ### Connection Pooling

          **Node.js / PostgreSQL:**
          ```javascript
          const { Pool } = require('pg');

          const pool = new Pool({
            connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
            ssl: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? { rejectUnauthorized: false } : false,
            max: 20, // Maximum pool size
            idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
            connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
          });
          ```

          **Python / PostgreSQL:**
          ```python
          import psycopg2.pool

          pool = psycopg2.pool.SimpleConnectionPool(
              minconn=1,
              maxconn=20,
              dsn=os.environ['DATABASE_URL']
          )
          ```

          **Django Settings:**
          ```python
          DATABASES = {
              'default': {
                  'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
                  'URL': os.environ['DATABASE_URL'],
                  'CONN_MAX_AGE': 600,  # Connection pooling
              }
          }
          ```

          ### Database Migrations

          **Run migrations during build:**

          **Django:**
          ```yaml
          buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py migrate
          ```

          **Rails:**
          ```yaml
          buildCommand: bundle install && bundle exec rails db:migrate
          ```

          **Node.js / Prisma:**
          ```yaml
          buildCommand: npm ci && npx prisma migrate deploy
          ```

          ---

          ## Free Tier Limitations

          ### What's Included

          **Free tier provides:**
          - 1 web service
          - 1 PostgreSQL database (1 GB storage, 97 MB RAM)
          - 750 hours/month compute
          - 512 MB RAM per service
          - 0.5 CPU per service
          - 100 GB bandwidth/month

          ### Resource Limits

          **Memory (512 MB):**
          - Monitor memory usage in logs
          - Optimize for memory-constrained environments
          - Use lightweight dependencies

          **CPU (0.5 cores):**
          - Suitable for low-traffic applications
          - Consider upgrading for higher traffic

          **Spin Down (Free services):**
          - Services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity
          - First request after spin down takes ~30 seconds (cold start)
          - Upgrade to paid tier for always-on services

          ### When to Upgrade

          **Upgrade to paid plan when:**
          - Need more than 1 web service
          - Need always-on services (no spin down)
          - Traffic exceeds free tier limits
          - Need more memory/CPU
          - Need faster build times
          - Need preview environments

          ## Health Checks

          ### Adding Health Check Endpoints

          **Node.js / Express:**
          ```javascript
          app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
            res.status(200).json({
              status: 'ok',
              timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
            });
          });
          ```

          **Python / Flask:**
          ```python
          @app.route('/health')
          def health():
              return {'status': 'ok'}, 200
          ```

          **Python / FastAPI:**
          ```python
          @app.get("/health")
          async def health():
              return {"status": "ok"}
          ```

          **Go:**
          ```go
          http.HandleFunc("/health", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
              w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
              w.Write([]byte(`{"status":"ok"}`))
          })
          ```

          ### Configure in render.yaml

          ```yaml
          services:
            - type: web
              name: my-app
              runtime: node
              healthCheckPath: /health
          ```

          **Benefits:**
          - Faster deployment detection
          - Better monitoring
          - Automatic restart on health check failures

          ## Common Deployment Issues

          ### Issue 1: Missing Environment Variables

          **Symptom:** Service crashes with "undefined variable" errors

          **Solution:** Add all required env vars to render.yaml:
          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: DATABASE_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: postgres
                property: connectionString
            - key: JWT_SECRET
              sync: false  # User fills in Dashboard
          ```

          ### Issue 2: Port Binding Errors

          **Symptom:** `EADDRINUSE` or health check timeout errors

          **Solution:** Ensure app binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`:
          ```javascript
          const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
          app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0');
          ```

          ### Issue 3: Build Hangs

          **Symptom:** Build times out after 15 minutes

          **Solution:** Use non-interactive build commands:
          ```yaml
          buildCommand: npm ci  # NOT npm install
          ```

          ### Issue 4: Database Connection Fails

          **Symptom:** `ECONNREFUSED` on port 5432

          **Solutions:**
          1. Use `fromDatabase` for automatic internal URLs
          2. Enable SSL for external connections
          3. Check `ipAllowList` settings

          ### Issue 5: Static Site 404s

          **Symptom:** Client-side routes return 404

          **Solution:** Add SPA rewrite rules:
          ```yaml
          routes:
            - type: rewrite
              source: /*
              destination: /index.html
          ```

          ### Issue 6: Out of Memory (OOM)

          **Symptom:** Service crashes with `JavaScript heap out of memory`

          **Solutions:**
          1. Optimize application memory usage
          2. Reduce dependency size
          3. Upgrade to higher plan with more RAM

          # Deployment Details

          Use this reference for service discovery, configuration patterns, quick commands, and common issues.

          ## Service Discovery

          **List all services:**
          ```
          list_services()
          ```
          Returns all services with IDs, names, types, and status.

          **Get specific service details:**
          ```
          get_service(serviceId: "<id>")
          ```
          Returns full configuration including environment variables and build/start commands.

          **List PostgreSQL databases:**
          ```
          list_postgres_instances()
          ```

          **List Key-Value stores:**
          ```
          list_key_value()
          ```

          ## Configuration Details

          ### Environment Variables

          **All environment variables must be declared in render.yaml.**

          **Three patterns for environment variables:**

          1. **Hardcoded values** (non-sensitive configuration):
          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: NODE_ENV
              value: production
            - key: API_URL
              value: https://api.example.com
          ```

          2. **Database connections** (auto-generated):
          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: DATABASE_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: postgres
                property: connectionString
            - key: REDIS_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: redis
                property: connectionString
          ```

          3. **Secrets** (user fills in Dashboard):
          ```yaml
          envVars:
            - key: JWT_SECRET
              sync: false
            - key: API_KEY
              sync: false
            - key: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
              sync: false
          ```

          Complete environment variable guide: [configuration-guide.md](configuration-guide.md)

          ### Port Binding

          **CRITICAL:** Web services must bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (NOT `localhost`). Render sets the `PORT` environment variable.

          **Node.js Example:**
          ```javascript
          const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
          app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
            console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
          });
          ```

          **Python Example:**
          ```python
          import os

          port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
          app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
          ```

          **Go Example:**
          ```go
          port := os.Getenv("PORT")
          if port == "" {
              port = "3000"
          }
          http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, handler)
          ```

          ### Plan Defaults

          **Use `plan: free` unless the user specifies otherwise.** Refer to Render pricing for current limits and capacity.

          ### Build Commands

          **Use non-interactive flags to prevent build hangs:**
          - npm: `npm ci`
          - yarn: `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
          - pnpm: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
          - bun: `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
          - pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
          - uv: `uv sync`
          - apt: `apt-get install -y <package>`
          - bundler: `bundle install --jobs=4 --retry=3`

          ### Database Connections

          When services connect to databases in the same Render account, use `fromDatabase` references for internal URLs.

          ### Health Checks

          Optional but recommended: add a `/health` endpoint for faster deployment detection.

          ## Quick Reference

          ## Common Issues

          **Issue:** Deployment fails with port binding error

          **Solution:** Ensure app binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (see Port Binding section above)

          ---

          **Issue:** Build hangs or times out

          **Solution:** Use non-interactive build commands (see Build Commands section above)

          ---

          **Issue:** Missing environment variables in Dashboard

          **Solution:** All env vars must be declared in render.yaml. Add missing vars with `sync: false` for secrets.

          ---

          **Issue:** Database connection fails

          **Solution:** Use `fromDatabase` references for internal connection strings.

          ---

          **Issue:** Static site shows 404 for routes

          **Solution:** Add rewrite rules to render.yaml for SPA routing:
          ```yaml
          routes:
            - type: rewrite
              source: /*
              destination: /index.html
          ```

          # Direct Creation (MCP) Details

          Use this reference for MCP direct-creation examples and follow-on configuration.

          ## Direct Creation Workflow

          ### Step 1: Analyze Codebase

          Use [codebase-analysis.md](codebase-analysis.md) to determine runtime, build/start commands, env vars, and datastores.

          ### Step 2: Create Resources via MCP

          **Create a Web Service:**
          ```
          create_web_service(
            name: "my-api",
            runtime: "node",  # or python, go, rust, ruby, elixir, docker
            repo: "https://github.com/username/repo",
            branch: "main",  # optional, defaults to repo default branch
            buildCommand: "npm ci",
            startCommand: "npm start",
            plan: "free",  # free, starter, standard, pro, pro_max, pro_plus, pro_ultra
            region: "oregon",  # oregon, frankfurt, singapore, ohio, virginia
            envVars: [
              {"key": "NODE_ENV", "value": "production"}
            ]
          )
          ```

          **Create a Static Site:**
          ```
          create_static_site(
            name: "my-frontend",
            repo: "https://github.com/username/repo",
            branch: "main",
            buildCommand: "npm run build",
            publishPath: "dist",  # or build, public, out
            envVars: [
              {"key": "VITE_API_URL", "value": "https://api.example.com"}
            ]
          )
          ```

          **Create a Cron Job:**
          ```
          create_cron_job(
            name: "daily-cleanup",
            runtime: "node",
            repo: "https://github.com/username/repo",
            schedule: "0 0 * * *",  # Daily at midnight (cron syntax)
            buildCommand: "npm ci",
            startCommand: "node scripts/cleanup.js",
            plan: "free"
          )
          ```

          **Create a PostgreSQL Database:**
          ```
          create_postgres(
            name: "myapp-db",
            plan: "free",  # free, basic_256mb, basic_1gb, basic_4gb, pro_4gb, etc.
            region: "oregon"
          )
          ```

          **Create a Key-Value Store (Redis):**
          ```
          create_key_value(
            name: "myapp-cache",
            plan: "free",  # free, starter, standard, pro, pro_plus
            region: "oregon",
            maxmemoryPolicy: "allkeys_lru"  # eviction policy
          )
          ```

          ### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

          After creating services, add environment variables:

          ```
          update_environment_variables(
            serviceId: "<service-id-from-creation>",
            envVars: [
              {"key": "DATABASE_URL", "value": "<connection-string>"},
              {"key": "JWT_SECRET", "value": "<secret-value>"},
              {"key": "API_KEY", "value": "<api-key>"}
            ]
          )
          ```

          **Note:** For database connection strings, get the internal URL from the database details in Dashboard or via `get_postgres(postgresId: "<id>")`.

          ### Step 4: Verify Deployment

          Services with `autoDeploy: "yes"` (default) will deploy automatically when created.

          **Check deployment status:**
          ```
          list_deploys(serviceId: "<service-id>", limit: 1)
          ```

          **Monitor logs for errors:**
          ```
          list_logs(resource: ["<service-id>"], level: ["error"], limit: 50)
          ```

          **Check health metrics:**
          ```
          get_metrics(
            resourceId: "<service-id>",
            metricTypes: ["http_request_count", "cpu_usage", "memory_usage"]
          )
          ```

          # Error patterns (compact)

          Use this to quickly map log signatures to likely causes and fixes.

          | Log pattern | Likely cause | Quick fix |
          | --- | --- | --- |
          | `KeyError`, `not defined`, `missing environment` | Missing env var | Add env var in render.yaml or via MCP, then redeploy |
          | `EADDRINUSE`, `listen EADDRINUSE` | Port binding conflict | Bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT` |
          | `Cannot find module`, `ModuleNotFoundError` | Missing dependency | Add dependency to manifest and rebuild |
          | `ECONNREFUSED`, `connection refused` | DB not reachable | Verify DATABASE_URL and DB status |
          | `Health check timeout` | No healthy response | Add/verify health endpoint and port |
          | `exit 137`, `out of memory` | OOM | Reduce memory use or upgrade plan |
          | `Command failed`, `build failed` | Bad build command | Fix build command or dependencies |
    - path: /skills/render-deploy/references/post-deploy-checks.md
      text: |
          # Post-deploy checks

          Use this after any deploy or service creation. Keep it short; stop when a check fails.

          ## 1) Confirm deploy status

          ```
          list_deploys(serviceId: "<service-id>", limit: 1)
          ```

          - Expect `status: "live"`.
          - If status is failed, inspect build/runtime logs immediately.

          ## 2) Verify service health

          - Hit the health endpoint (preferred) or `/` and confirm a 200 response.
          - If there is no health endpoint, add one and redeploy.

          ## 3) Scan recent error logs

          ```
          list_logs(resource: ["<service-id>"], level: ["error"], limit: 50)
          ```

          - If you see a clear error signature, jump to the matching fix in
            [troubleshooting-basics.md](troubleshooting-basics.md) or
            [error-patterns.md](error-patterns.md).

          ## 4) Verify env vars and port binding

          - Confirm all required env vars are set (especially secrets marked `sync: false`).
          - Ensure the app binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (not localhost).

          ## 5) Redeploy only after fixing the first failure

          - Avoid repeated deploys without changes; fix one issue at a time.

          ## Container Runtimes

          ### Docker (`runtime: docker`)

          Build your application from a Dockerfile in your repository.

          **Additional Configuration:**
          - `dockerfilePath`: Path to Dockerfile (default: `./Dockerfile`)
          - `dockerContext`: Build context directory (default: `.`)

          **Example Configuration:**
          ```yaml
          type: web
          name: docker-app
          runtime: docker
          dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
          dockerContext: .
          ```

          **Multi-stage Dockerfile Example:**
          ```dockerfile
          # Build stage
          FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
          WORKDIR /app
          COPY package*.json ./
          RUN npm ci
          COPY . .
          RUN npm run build

          # Production stage
          FROM node:20-alpine
          WORKDIR /app
          COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
          COPY package*.json ./
          RUN npm ci --only=production
          EXPOSE 10000
          CMD ["node", "dist/main.js"]
          ```

          **Best Practices:**
          - Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size
          - Copy `package.json` before source code (better caching)
          - Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files
          - Expose port dynamically via `$PORT` environment variable
          - Run as non-root user for security

          ---

          ### Pre-built Image (`runtime: image`)

          Deploy pre-built Docker images from a container registry.

          **Additional Configuration:**
          - `image`: Full image URL with tag or digest
          - `registryCredential`: Credentials for private registries

          **Example with Public Image:**
          ```yaml
          type: web
          name: prebuilt-app
          runtime: image
          image: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/meshagent-public/images/cli:{SERVER_VERSION}-esgz
          ```

          **Example with Private Registry:**
          ```yaml
          type: web
          name: private-app
          runtime: image
          image: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/meshagent-public/images/cli:{SERVER_VERSION}-esgz
          registryCredential:
            username: my-username
            password:
              sync: false  # User provides in Dashboard
          ```

          **Use Cases:**
          - Deploy images built in CI/CD pipeline
          - Use images from container registries
          - Deploy Docker Hub images
          - Use private registry images

          ---

          ## Static Runtime (`runtime: static`)

          Serve pre-built static files without a backend runtime. Files are served via CDN.

          **Additional Configuration:**
          - `staticPublishPath`: Directory containing built files (e.g., `./dist`, `./build`)

          **Common Build Commands by Framework:**

          **React (Create React App):**
          ```bash
          npm ci && npm run build
          # Outputs to: ./build
          ```

          **Vue:**
          ```bash
          npm ci && npm run build
          # Outputs to: ./dist
          ```

          **Next.js (Static Export):**
          ```bash
          npm ci && npm run build && npm run export
          # Outputs to: ./out
          ```

          **Gatsby:**
          ```bash
          npm ci && npm run build
          # Outputs to: ./public
          ```

          **Vite:**
          ```bash
          npm ci && npm run build
          # Outputs to: ./dist
          ```

          **Example Configuration:**
          ```yaml
          type: web
          name: react-app
          runtime: static
          buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
          staticPublishPath: ./build
          ```

          ---

          ## Runtime Comparison

          | Runtime | Build Speed | Cold Start | Best For |
          |---------|-------------|------------|----------|
          | Node.js | Fast | Fast | APIs, full-stack apps |

          # Render Service Types

          Detailed explanation of each service type available on Render. Choose the right service type based on your application's needs.

          ## Web Services (`type: web`)

          ### Purpose

          Web services are HTTP servers that handle incoming requests from the internet. They're publicly accessible via HTTPS URLs.

          ### Use Cases

          - **REST APIs**: JSON APIs for mobile apps or frontend applications
          - **GraphQL servers**: GraphQL endpoints for client queries
          - **Web applications**: Server-rendered websites (Django, Rails, Express)
          - **Full-stack frameworks**: Next.js, Nuxt.js, Remix, SvelteKit
          - **WebSocket servers**: Real-time communication servers
          - **SSR applications**: Server-side rendered React, Vue, or Angular apps

          ### Key Characteristics

          - **Public URL**: Automatically assigned `https://[service-name].onrender.com`
          - **Port binding required**: Must bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
          - **Health checks**: Render pings your service to verify it's running
          - **HTTPS**: Automatic SSL/TLS certificates
          - **Load balancing**: Traffic distributed across multiple instances
          - **Custom domains**: Support for your own domain names

          ### Required Configuration

          ```yaml
          type: web
          name: my-api
          runtime: node
          buildCommand: npm ci
          startCommand: npm start
          ```

          ### Best Practices

          1. **Bind to environment PORT**:
          ```javascript
          const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
          app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0');
          ```

          2. **Add health check endpoint**:
          ```javascript
          app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
            res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok' });
          });
          ```

          3. **Use appropriate timeouts**: Web requests should complete within 30 seconds

          4. **Implement graceful shutdown**: Handle SIGTERM signals properly

          ---

          ## Worker Services (`type: worker`)

          ### Purpose

          Worker services run background tasks without handling HTTP requests. They're not publicly accessible.

          ### Use Cases

          - **Queue processors**: Redis queue, BullMQ, Celery, Sidekiq
          - **Background jobs**: Email sending, image processing, data exports
          - **Event consumers**: Message queue consumers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)
          - **Data pipeline workers**: ETL processes, data transformation
          - **Scheduled background tasks**: Continuous processes (not cron)
          - **WebSocket backend**: Dedicated WebSocket handler services

          ### Key Characteristics

          - **No public URL**: Not accessible from internet
          - **No port binding**: Doesn't need to listen on a port
          - **No health checks**: Render monitors process health differently
          - **Long-running**: Can run indefinitely
          - **Private communication**: Access via internal networking
          - **Restart on crash**: Automatically restarted if process dies

          ### Required Configuration

          ```yaml
          type: worker
          name: queue-processor
          runtime: python
          buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
          startCommand: celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info
          ```

          ### Best Practices

          1. **Connect to message queue**:
          ```python
          import redis
          r = redis.from_url(os.environ['REDIS_URL'])
          ```

          2. **Implement retry logic**: Handle failures gracefully

          3. **Monitor queue depth**: Track pending jobs

          4. **Log processing status**: Make debugging easier

          5. **Graceful shutdown**: Finish current jobs before exiting

          ### Common Patterns

          **Node.js with BullMQ:**
          ```yaml
          type: worker
          name: job-processor
          runtime: node
          buildCommand: npm ci
          startCommand: node worker.js
          envVars:
            - key: REDIS_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: redis
                property: connectionString
          ```

          **Python with Celery:**
          ```yaml
          type: worker
          name: celery-worker
          runtime: python
          buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
          startCommand: celery -A app.celery worker
          envVars:
            - key: REDIS_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: redis
                property: connectionString
          ```

          ## Cron Jobs (`type: cron`)

          ### Purpose

          Cron jobs run scheduled tasks on a repeating schedule. They execute, complete, and shut down.

          ### Use Cases

          - **Database backups**: Regular automated backups
          - **Report generation**: Daily/weekly reports
          - **Data cleanup**: Delete old records periodically
          - **Cache warming**: Pre-populate caches
          - **Email digests**: Send scheduled email summaries
          - **Data synchronization**: Sync between systems
          - **Batch processing**: Process accumulated data

          ### Key Characteristics

          - **Scheduled execution**: Runs on cron schedule
          - **Automatic shutdown**: Shuts down after completing
          - **No persistent port**: Doesn't maintain listening port
          - **No health checks**: Task either completes or fails
          - **UTC timezone**: All schedules in UTC
          - **Maximum runtime**: Jobs timeout after configured limit

          ### Required Configuration

          ```yaml
          type: cron
          name: daily-backup
          runtime: node
          schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM UTC
          buildCommand: npm ci
          startCommand: node scripts/backup.js
          ```

          ### Schedule Format

          Standard cron syntax: `minute hour day month weekday`

          **Common schedules:**

          | Schedule | Description |
          |----------|-------------|
          | `*/5 * * * *` | Every 5 minutes |
          | `0 * * * *` | Every hour |
          | `0 0 * * *` | Daily at midnight UTC |
          | `0 9 * * 1-5` | Weekdays at 9 AM UTC |
          | `0 0 1 * *` | First day of each month |
          | `0 9 * * 1` | Every Monday at 9 AM UTC |

          ### Best Practices

          1. **Handle failures gracefully**: Jobs should be idempotent

          2. **Log completion status**: Track success/failure

          3. **Set appropriate timeouts**: Match expected job duration

          4. **Use UTC times**: All schedules are UTC-based

          5. **Test thoroughly**: Test with different data scenarios

          ### Example Use Cases

          **Daily Database Backup:**
          ```yaml
          type: cron
          name: db-backup
          runtime: python
          schedule: "0 1 * * *"  # 1 AM UTC daily
          buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
          startCommand: python scripts/backup.py
          envVars:
            - key: DATABASE_URL
              fromDatabase:
                name: postgres
                property: connectionString
            - key: S3_BUCKET
              value: my-backups
          ```

          **Hourly Cache Refresh:**
          ```yaml
          type: cron
          name: cache-refresh
          runtime: node
          schedule: "0 * * * *"  # Top of every hour
          buildCommand: npm ci
          startCommand: node scripts/refresh-cache.js
          ```

          ---

          ## Static Sites (`type: web` + `runtime: static`)

          ### Purpose

          Serve static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files via CDN. No backend runtime.

          ### Use Cases

          - **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**: React, Vue, Angular apps
          - **Static site generators**: Gatsby, Next.js (static export), Hugo
          - **Documentation sites**: MkDocs, Docusaurus, VitePress
          - **Landing pages**: Marketing sites
          - **Portfolio sites**: Personal websites
          - **JAMstack sites**: Static sites with API integration

          ### Key Characteristics

          - **CDN delivery**: Global edge caching
          - **No backend runtime**: Only serves built files
          - **Build output only**: Serves contents of build directory
          - **Routing support**: Rewrite rules for SPA routing
          - **Custom headers**: Cache control, security headers
          - **Fast deployment**: Quick to build and deploy

          ### Required Configuration

          ```yaml
          type: web
          name: frontend
          runtime: static
          buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
          staticPublishPath: ./dist  # or ./build, ./out, ./public
          ```

          ### Routing for SPAs

          Single Page Applications need rewrite rules to handle client-side routing:

          ```yaml
          type: web
          name: react-app
          runtime: static
          buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
          staticPublishPath: ./build
          routes:
            - type: rewrite
              source: /*
              destination: /index.html
          ```

          ### Custom Headers

          Add cache control and security headers:

          ```yaml
          type: web
          name: static-site
          runtime: static
          buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
          staticPublishPath: ./dist
          headers:
            # Cache static assets
            - path: /static/*
              name: Cache-Control
              value: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

            # Security headers
            - path: /*
              name: X-Frame-Options
              value: DENY
            - path: /*
              name: X-Content-Type-Options
              value: nosniff
          ```

          ### Build Filters

          For monorepos, only build when frontend files change:

          ```yaml
          type: web
          name: frontend
          runtime: static
          buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
          staticPublishPath: ./dist
          buildFilter:
            paths:
              - frontend/**
            ignoredPaths:
              - frontend/**/*.test.js
              - frontend/README.md
          ```

          ### Best Practices

          1. **Optimize build output**: Minify, compress, tree-shake

          2. **Use proper cache headers**: Long cache for hashed assets

          3. **Add security headers**: Protect against common attacks

          4. **Configure SPA routing**: Add rewrite rules for client routing

          5. **Handle 404s**: Create custom 404.html page

          ## Private Services (`type: pserv`)

          ### Purpose

          Internal services accessible only within your Render account. Not exposed to the internet.

          ### Use Cases

          - **Internal APIs**: Services accessed only by other services
          - **Database proxies**: Connection pools, read replicas
          - **Microservices**: Service mesh architectures
          - **Admin tools**: Internal dashboards
          - **Cache layers**: Internal caching services
          - **Message brokers**: Internal message queues

          ### Key Characteristics

          - **No public URL**: Only accessible via internal DNS
          - **Internal networking**: Fast, low-latency connections
          - **Port binding required**: Must bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
          - **Private DNS**: `[service-name].render-internal.com`
          - **Same-account only**: Only accessible from same account
          - **No internet access**: Traffic stays within Render network

          ### Required Configuration

          ```yaml
          type: pserv
          name: internal-api
          runtime: node
          buildCommand: npm ci
          startCommand: npm start
          ```

          ### Accessing Private Services

          From other services in the same account:

          ```javascript
          // Use .render-internal.com domain
          const API_URL = 'http://internal-api.render-internal.com:10000';
          ```

          Or use service references:

          ```yaml
          services:
            - type: web
              name: frontend
              runtime: node
              envVars:
                - key: INTERNAL_API_URL
                  fromService:
                    name: internal-api
                    type: pserv
                    property: hostport
          ```

          ### Best Practices

          1. **Use internal DNS**: Always use `.render-internal.com` domains

          2. **No authentication needed**: Already isolated to account

          3. **Fast communication**: Low latency between services

          4. **Simplify architecture**: No need for external load balancers

          | Use Case | HTTP servers | Background jobs | Scheduled tasks | Static files | Internal services |

          ## Choosing the Right Service Type

          **Use Web Service when:**
          - Your app handles HTTP requests
          - Users need to access it via URL
          - You need load balancing and scaling

          **Use Worker Service when:**
          - Processing background jobs
          - Consuming from message queues
          - Running long-lived processes without HTTP

          **Use Cron Job when:**
          - Running scheduled tasks
          - Processing doesn't need to be always-on
          - Tasks run periodically (hourly, daily, weekly)

          **Use Static Site when:**
          - Serving pre-built HTML/CSS/JS
          - No backend processing needed
          - Want CDN caching and fast delivery

          **Use Private Service when:**
          - Service only accessed by other services
          - Want internal-only communication
          - Building microservice architectures

          # Basic troubleshooting (deploy-time and startup)

          Use this when a deploy fails, the service crashes on start, or health checks time out.
          Keep fixes minimal and redeploy after each change.

          ## 1) Classify the failure

          - **Build failure**: errors in build logs, missing dependencies, build command issues.
          - **Startup failure**: app exits quickly, crashes, or cannot bind to `$PORT`.
          - **Runtime/health failure**: service is live but health checks fail or 5xx errors.

          ## 2) Quick checks by class

          **Build failure**
          - Confirm the build command is correct for the runtime.
          - Ensure required dependencies are present in `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.
          - Check for missing build-time env vars.

          **Startup failure**
          - Confirm the start command and working directory.
          - Ensure port binding is `0.0.0.0:$PORT`.
          - Check for missing runtime env vars (secrets, DB URLs).

          **Runtime/health failure**
          - Verify the health endpoint path and response.
          - Confirm the app is actually listening on `$PORT`.
          - Check database connectivity and migrations.

          ## 3) Map error signatures to fixes

          Use [error-patterns.md](error-patterns.md) for a compact catalog of common log messages.

          ## 4) If still blocked

          Gather the latest build logs and runtime error logs, then consider the optional
          `render-debug` skill for deeper diagnostics (metrics, DB checks, expanded patterns).
