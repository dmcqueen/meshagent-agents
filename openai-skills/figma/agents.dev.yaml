             3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                as of the date such litigation is filed.

             4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                meet the following conditions:

                (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and

                (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and

                (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.

                You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                the conditions stated in this License.

             5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

             6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

             7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

             8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

             9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

          name: figma
          description: Use the Figma MCP server to fetch design context, screenshots, variables, and assets from Figma, and to translate Figma nodes into production code. Trigger when a task involves Figma URLs, node IDs, design-to-code implementation, or Figma MCP setup and troubleshooting.
          ---

          # Figma MCP

          Use the Figma MCP server for Figma-driven implementation. For setup and debugging details (env vars, config, verification), see `references/figma-mcp-config.md`.

          ## Figma MCP Integration Rules
          These rules define how to translate Figma inputs into code for this project and must be followed for every Figma-driven change.

          ### Required flow (do not skip)
          1. Run get_design_context first to fetch the structured representation for the exact node(s).
          2. If the response is too large or truncated, run get_metadata to get the high-level node map and then re-fetch only the required node(s) with get_design_context.
          3. Run get_screenshot for a visual reference of the node variant being implemented.
          4. Only after you have both get_design_context and get_screenshot, download any assets needed and start implementation.
          5. Translate the output (usually React + Tailwind) into this project's conventions, styles and framework. Reuse the project's color tokens, components, and typography wherever possible.
          6. Validate against Figma for 1:1 look and behavior before marking complete.

          ### Implementation rules
          - Treat the Figma MCP output (React + Tailwind) as a representation of design and behavior, not as final code style.
          - Replace Tailwind utility classes with the project's preferred utilities/design-system tokens when applicable.
          - Reuse existing components (e.g., buttons, inputs, typography, icon wrappers) instead of duplicating functionality.
          - Use the project's color system, typography scale, and spacing tokens consistently.
          - Respect existing routing, state management, and data-fetch patterns already adopted in the repo.
          - Strive for 1:1 visual parity with the Figma design. When conflicts arise, prefer design-system tokens and adjust spacing or sizes minimally to match visuals.
          - Validate the final UI against the Figma screenshot for both look and behavior.

          ### Asset handling
          - The Figma MCP Server provides an assets endpoint which can serve image and SVG assets.
          - IMPORTANT: If the Figma MCP Server returns a localhost source for an image or an SVG, use that image or SVG source directly.
          - IMPORTANT: DO NOT import/add new icon packages, all the assets should be in the Figma payload.
          - IMPORTANT: do NOT use or create placeholders if a localhost source is provided.

          ### Link-based prompting
          - The server is link-based: copy the Figma frame/layer link and give that URL to the MCP client when asking for implementation help.
          - The client cannot browse the URL but extracts the node ID from the link; always ensure the link points to the exact node/variant you want.

          # Figma MCP config reference

          Use this snippet to register the Figma MCP server in `~/.codex/config.toml` as a streamable HTTP server with bearer auth pulled from your env.

          ```toml
          [mcp_servers.figma]
          url = "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp"
          bearer_token_env_var = "FIGMA_OAUTH_TOKEN"
          http_headers = { "X-Figma-Region" = "us-east-1" }
          ```

          ## Notes and options
          - The bearer token must be available as `FIGMA_OAUTH_TOKEN` in the environment that launches Codex.
          - Keep the region header aligned with your Figma region. If your org uses another region, update `X-Figma-Region` consistently.
          - OAuth on streamable HTTP requires the RMCP client: set `[features].rmcp_client = true` (or `experimental_use_rmcp_client = true` on older builds) at the top level of `config.toml`.
          - Optional per-server timeouts: `startup_timeout_sec` (default 10) and `tool_timeout_sec` (default 60) can be set inside `[mcp_servers.figma]` if needed.

          ## Env var setup (if missing)
          - One-time set for current shell: `export FIGMA_OAUTH_TOKEN="<token>"`
          - Persist for future sessions: add the export line to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`), then restart the shell or your IDE.
          - Verify before launching Codex: `echo $FIGMA_OAUTH_TOKEN` should print a non-empty token.

          ## Setup + verification checklist
          - Add the snippet above to `~/.codex/config.toml` under `[mcp_servers.figma]`, and enable `[features].rmcp_client = true` (or `experimental_use_rmcp_client = true` on older releases).
          - Restart Codex (CLI/IDE) after updating config and env vars.
          - Ask Codex to list Figma tools or run a simple call to confirm the server is reachable.

          ## Troubleshooting
          - Token not picked up: Export `FIGMA_OAUTH_TOKEN` in the same shell that launches Codex, or add it to your shell profile and restart.
          - OAuth errors: Verify `rmcp_client` is enabled and the bearer token is valid. Tokens copied from Figma should not include surrounding quotes.
          - Network/headers: Keep the `X-Figma-Region` header; if your org uses another region, update the header consistently across config and requests.

          ## Usage reminders
          - The server is link-based: copy the Figma frame or layer link, then ask the MCP client to implement that URL. The client will extract the node ID from the link (it does not browse the page).
          - If output feels generic, restate the project-specific rules from the main skill and ensure you follow the required flow (get_design_context → get_metadata if needed → get_screenshot).

          # Figma MCP tools and prompt patterns

          Quick reference for the Figma MCP toolset, when to use each tool, and prompt examples to steer output toward your stack.

          ## Core tools
          - `get_design_context` (Figma Design, Figma Make): Primary tool. Returns structured design data and default React + Tailwind code. Selection-based prompting works on desktop; the remote server uses a frame/layer link to extract the node ID.
          - `get_variable_defs` (Figma Design): Lists variables/styles (colors, spacing, typography) used in the selection. Useful to align with tokens.
          - `get_metadata` (Figma Design): Sparse XML outline of layer IDs/names/types/positions/sizes. Use before re-calling `get_design_context` on large nodes to avoid truncation.
          - `get_screenshot` (Figma Design, FigJam): Screenshot of the selection for visual fidelity checks.
          - `get_figjam` (FigJam): XML + screenshots for FigJam diagrams (architecture, flows).
          - `create_design_system_rules` (no file context): Generates a rule file with design-to-code guidance for your stack. Save it where the agent can read it.
          - `get_code_connect_map` (Figma Design): Returns mapping of Figma node IDs to code components (`codeConnectSrc`, `codeConnectName`). Use to reuse existing components.
          - `add_code_connect_map` (Figma Design): Adds/updates a mapping between a Figma node and a code component to improve reuse.
          - `get_strategy_for_mapping` (alpha, local only): Figma-prompted tool to decide mapping strategy for connecting a node to a code component.
          - `send_get_strategy_response` (alpha, local only): Sends the response after `get_strategy_for_mapping`.
          - `whoami` (remote only): Returns the authenticated Figma user identity (email, plans, seat types).

          ## Prompt patterns (design context)
          - Change framework: “generate my Figma selection in Vue” or “in plain HTML + CSS” or “for iOS”.
          - Use my components: “generate my Figma selection using components from `src/components/ui`”.
          - Combine: “generate my Figma selection using components from `src/ui` and style with Tailwind”.
          - Note: On the remote server, selection-based prompting requires a frame/layer link; the server extracts the node ID from the URL.

          ## Prompt patterns (variables/styles)
          - “get the variables used in my Figma selection”
          - “what color and spacing variables are used in my Figma selection?”
          - “list the variable names and their values used in my Figma selection”

          ## Prompt patterns (code connect)
          - “show the code connect map for this selection”
          - “map this node to `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` with name `Button`”

          ## Best-practice flow reminder
          Use `get_design_context` → (optionally `get_metadata` for large nodes) → `get_screenshot`, and keep project rules from `SKILL.md` in mind when applying the generated output.
