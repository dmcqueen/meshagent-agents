  "description": "An agent that uses OpenAI's figma skill and powered by gpt-5.2",
  "long_description": "This agent lets users and teams interact directly with Figma work by asking domain-specific questions, turning ambiguous requests into clear, actionable design tasks, and receiving guidance tailored to their goals and constraints. Teams can use it to clarify design intent, translate high-level requirements into concrete edits or workflows, and get step-by-step recommendations for handling components, layouts, and collaboration scenarios. It is built to adapt its responses based on project context so outputs are practical and aligned with team needs, helping speed decision-making and reduce back-and-forth during design iterations. When necessary, it references a capable language model runtime to reason about design problems and produce precise, actionable instructions.",
