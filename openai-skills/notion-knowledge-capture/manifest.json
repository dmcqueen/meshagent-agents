  "description": "An agent that uses OpenAI's notion-knowledge-capture skill",
  "long_description": "This agent helps users and teams capture, organize, and act on knowledge inside a Notion-style workspace by turning ambiguous requests into clear, actionable outputs and answering domain-specific questions about knowledge-capture workflows. Teams can use it to convert loose notes or ideas into structured entries, generate prioritized action items and summaries, and adapt guidance to fit project goals and constraints so work moves from concept to execution more efficiently. It supports iterative refinement of content and workflows based on user context and objectives, enabling clearer decision-making and more consistent knowledge management.",
