             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
             the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
             and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
             or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
             License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
             on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
             any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          name: "jupyter-notebook"
          description: "Use when the user asks to create, scaffold, or edit Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) for experiments, explorations, or tutorials; prefer the bundled templates and run the helper script `new_notebook.py` to generate a clean starting notebook."
          ---


          # Jupyter Notebook Skill

          Create clean, reproducible Jupyter notebooks for two primary modes:

          - Experiments and exploratory analysis
          - Tutorials and teaching-oriented walkthroughs

          Prefer the bundled templates and the helper script for consistent structure and fewer JSON mistakes.

          ## When to use
          - Create a new `.ipynb` notebook from scratch.
          - Convert rough notes or scripts into a structured notebook.
          - Refactor an existing notebook to be more reproducible and skimmable.
          - Build experiments or tutorials that will be read or re-run by other people.

          ## Decision tree
          - If the request is exploratory, analytical, or hypothesis-driven, choose `experiment`.
          - If the request is instructional, step-by-step, or audience-specific, choose `tutorial`.
          - If editing an existing notebook, treat it as a refactor: preserve intent and improve structure.

          ## Skill path (set once)

          ```bash
          export CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
          export JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_CLI="$CODEX_HOME/skills/jupyter-notebook/scripts/new_notebook.py"
          ```

          User-scoped skills install under `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (default: `~/.codex/skills`).

          ## Workflow
          1. Lock the intent.
          Identify the notebook kind: `experiment` or `tutorial`.
          Capture the objective, audience, and what "done" looks like.

          2. Scaffold from the template.
          Use the helper script to avoid hand-authoring raw notebook JSON.

          ```bash
          uv run --python 3.12 python "$JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_CLI" \
            --kind experiment \
            --title "Compare prompt variants" \
            --out output/jupyter-notebook/compare-prompt-variants.ipynb
          ```

          ```bash
          uv run --python 3.12 python "$JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_CLI" \
            --kind tutorial \
            --title "Intro to embeddings" \
            --out output/jupyter-notebook/intro-to-embeddings.ipynb
          ```

          3. Fill the notebook with small, runnable steps.
          Keep each code cell focused on one step.
          Add short markdown cells that explain the purpose and expected result.
          Avoid large, noisy outputs when a short summary works.

          4. Apply the right pattern.
          For experiments, follow `references/experiment-patterns.md`.
          For tutorials, follow `references/tutorial-patterns.md`.

          5. Edit safely when working with existing notebooks.
          Preserve the notebook structure; avoid reordering cells unless it improves the top-to-bottom story.
          Prefer targeted edits over full rewrites.
          If you must edit raw JSON, review `references/notebook-structure.md` first.

          6. Validate the result.
          Run the notebook top-to-bottom when the environment allows.
          If execution is not possible, say so explicitly and call out how to validate locally.
          Use the final pass checklist in `references/quality-checklist.md`.

          ## Templates and helper script
          - Templates live in `assets/experiment-template.ipynb` and `assets/tutorial-template.ipynb`.
          - The helper script loads a template, updates the title cell, and writes a notebook.

          Script path:
          - `$JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_CLI` (installed default: `$CODEX_HOME/skills/jupyter-notebook/scripts/new_notebook.py`)

          ## Temp and output conventions
          - Use `tmp/jupyter-notebook/` for intermediate files; delete when done.
          - Write final artifacts under `output/jupyter-notebook/` when working in this repo.
          - Use stable, descriptive filenames (for example, `ablation-temperature.ipynb`).

          ## Dependencies (install only when needed)
          Prefer `uv` for dependency management.

          Optional Python packages for local notebook execution:

          ```bash
          uv pip install jupyterlab ipykernel
          ```

          The bundled scaffold script uses only the Python standard library and does not require extra dependencies.

          ## Environment
          No required environment variables.

          ## Reference map
          - `references/experiment-patterns.md`: experiment structure and heuristics.
          - `references/tutorial-patterns.md`: tutorial structure and teaching flow.
          - `references/notebook-structure.md`: notebook JSON shape and safe editing rules.
          - `references/quality-checklist.md`: final validation checklist.

          # Experiment Patterns

          Use this structure for exploratory and experimental work:

          - Title and objective: state the question and the success criteria.
          - Setup and reproducibility: import only what you need, set a seed early, and keep configuration in one short cell.
          - Plan: list hypotheses, sweeps, and metrics before running code.
          - Minimal baseline: start with the smallest runnable example and confirm it runs end-to-end before adding complexity.
          - Results and notes: summarize findings in markdown near the relevant code and record key metrics in a small dictionary or table-like structure.
          - Next steps: decide whether to continue, pivot, or stop, and capture follow-up ideas as short bullets.

          # Notebook Structure

          Jupyter notebooks are JSON documents with this high-level shape:

          - `nbformat` and `nbformat_minor`
          - `metadata`
          - `cells` (a list of markdown and code cells)

          When editing `.ipynb` files programmatically:

          - Preserve `nbformat` and `nbformat_minor` from the template.
          - Keep `cells` as an ordered list; do not reorder unless intentional.
          - For code cells, set `execution_count` to `null` when unknown.
          - For code cells, set `outputs` to an empty list when scaffolding.
          - For markdown cells, keep `cell_type="markdown"` and `metadata={}`.

          Prefer scaffolding from the bundled templates or `new_notebook.py` (for example, `$CODEX_HOME/skills/jupyter-notebook/scripts/new_notebook.py`) instead of hand-authoring raw notebook JSON.

          # Quality Checklist

          Before delivering a notebook:

          - Run it top-to-bottom at least once (or as much as the environment allows).
          - Ensure early cells set all required state; avoid hidden state from prior runs.
          - Keep outputs tidy. Avoid giant outputs when a short summary works.
          - Prefer small tables, key metrics, or short printouts.
          - Keep the narrative skimmable. Use headings and short bullets, and avoid long paragraphs.
          - Leave helpful TODOs only when necessary, and label them clearly.
          - If execution is not possible, call out the risk and how to validate locally.

          # Tutorial Patterns

          Use this structure for teaching and walkthroughs:

          - Audience, prerequisites, and learning goals: say who it is for, list what they should already know, and state what they will be able to do by the end.
          - Outline: provide a short numbered outline so readers can skim.
          - Step-by-step flow: pair a short markdown explanation with a small code cell that runs on its own and a brief interpretation of the result.
          - Exercises: include at least one exercise that reinforces the key concept and provide an answer scaffold in the next cell.
          - Pitfalls and extensions: call out one common mistake and how to fix it, and suggest one optional extension for curious readers.
